            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Reverend, Pious, and Learned Dr. <hi>Richard Busby,</hi> Prebend of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and Chief Master of the ROYAL-SCHOOL there.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honour'd SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have made bold to prefix Your Name before this little Tract, knowing that it wants some Great Patronage, and therefore Yours; who are so able to confute them, who
<pb facs="tcp:205033:3"/>oppose the Truth here asserted; and so willing to countenance such, as own and would defend it. I was also ambitious, before You leave the World, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint it with my great Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to You. If there be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any gross Mistakes, they are mine; if there be any thing of Worth and Learning, I owe it to You; who, in my Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were to me, not a Master on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but even as a Father; and, which is a Relation more rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found, a real Friend; for, I was not only protected under, but nourished by, Your warm and cherishing Wing.</p>
            <p>Such You were to me, and to Thousands more; so that I may, within Truth, and without
<pb facs="tcp:205033:3"/>Flattery, tell the World, That there is scarce any Man in it, who hath done more Good than You. To You doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> owe great store of her choicest Divines; and it is no Fault of Yours, that I my self am none of that happy Number. To You do the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns of <hi>England</hi> owe very many of our ablest Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; and to You doth <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall,</hi> both it's Barrs and it's Benches, owe many of our most Learned Lawyers. So that Your daily Care, Your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Industry, and prudent Conduct, have had a very sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Influence upon every thing, that may prove most Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the Estates, Bodies,
<pb facs="tcp:205033:4"/>and Souls of Men: And how can any Person oblige a Church or Nation more?</p>
            <p>And were I not afraid to put Your great Modesty to the blush; I think, I might justly say, That more Scholars, well grounded in the Principles of Morality, Piety, and Learning, have been trained up under Your happy Government, than were ever bred by any one Master, in any one School, since the World begun.</p>
            <p>'Tis indeed much to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that some of Your Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, who have proved debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and vicious, will, in the Event, fare the worse for that vertuous Example, and those pious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, which You often
<pb facs="tcp:205033:4"/>gave them; for their Christian Education in Your School and Family, will add many Ounces to the Weight of their Crimes, and double their Iniquities. Nor can we wonder, if such profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Wretches, instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Thanks to their worthy Master, should now and then drop some hard and undeserved Speeches concerning him; act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much like those ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Clouds, which darken the Sun, that raised them. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, the Honour of Your Name, like the Beams of the Sun dissipating and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through such empty Clouds, doth and will shine as bright as ever.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:205033:5"/>
            <p> And now, as I am loath to displease You by Publishing, so am I unwilling to injure the World by concealing Your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Acts of Piety to God, and Charity to Men; Your ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a decent Parochial Church for Divine Worship; a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Parsonage-House for the Minister, and an Alms-House for the Poor; Your frequent send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considerable Supplies to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners for Debt; Your relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving distressed Ministers, turned out of all by the fury of blind Zealots, the Rabble, and Dregs of Mankind. But these things I only name, leaving them to be illustrated and recorded by some abler Pen, and transmitted to Posterity as Great Examples,
<pb facs="tcp:205033:5"/>which all Men must commend, but, I fear, few will imitate, at least in the same Degree and Eminence.</p>
            <p>'Tis now high time to take my leave; and yet before I do so, I would beg one thing from You, and another thing for You; from You, I would beg a Pardon for this Presumption; and for You, I would beg that Your Passage to Heaven may prove as easie, as, I know, 'tis safe; that when Your Candle shall grow near the Socket, it may not be extinguished by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny violent Storm, but expire of its self, and go out only for want of Oil; that every Sand of Your Glass may run out gently and freely, even without
<pb facs="tcp:205033:6"/>a shake; that You may do no more than quietly fall asleep. So prayeth,</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THis little Tract, here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to thy view, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately written, and is now publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to gain <hi>Applause,</hi> for it deserves none; not to gain <hi>Money,</hi> for its Author is not mercenary; but to <hi>do Good,</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> a <hi>Truth,</hi> and a very great one too. Though it be not penned so well, as I do, and thou maist wish, yet the <hi>Justice</hi> of its Author's <hi>Design</hi> may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what excuse and atone for the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:205033:7"/>of the <hi>Work</hi> it self. And the rather, because it may be hoped, that this <hi>attempting</hi> a <hi>weak</hi> Defence, may provoke some abler Person to <hi>make</hi> a <hi>strong</hi> one.</p>
            <p>We are all commanded,
<note place="margin">Jude 1.</note>
               <hi>To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend earnestly for the Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints.</hi> This Faith stands record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Bibles; this Faith hath the Catholick Church embraced and vigorously maintain'd against all its Opposers. And for this Faith must we also contend, though it be with <hi>Blood;</hi> not by <hi>shedding other</hi> Mens; but, if just occasion should so require, by <hi>losing</hi> our <hi>own.</hi> We must likewise contend for this Faith, as well as we can, by strength of <hi>Argument;</hi> but our chief Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, to be used in this Quarrel, is,
<pb facs="tcp:205033:7"/>
               <hi>The Sword of the Spirt,</hi> and that must be fetched and drawn from the <hi>Armoury</hi> of God; for,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 21.9.</note>
               <hi>there is none like that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this Divine Sword did the great Champions of this Faith in the Four first <hi>General Councils</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend against <hi>Arius, Nestorius, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches,</hi> and <hi>Macedonius;</hi> with the same Sword did the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who were famous both for <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> both in the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Churches, contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the <hi>Heresies,</hi> which arose in their respective Ages. And of the same Weapon have we need e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in this unhappy Age of ours.</p>
            <p>For, we find that Prophecy of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s fulfilled this Day in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> which saith,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note>
               <hi>There shall be false Teachers among you,
<pb facs="tcp:205033:8"/>who shall privily bring in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heresies,</hi> and the only dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heresie, which he particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly names, is this, <hi>even denying the Lord, that bought them.</hi> There are indeed several ways of denying our Lord; but of them all, I think, the denying of his <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is the <hi>worst.</hi> For that deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the highest <hi>Dignity</hi> of his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> the Infinite <hi>value</hi> of his <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;</hi> and, by a necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the World by his Blood.</p>
            <p>We grant indeed, that if it had been the good Pleasure of God so to do, he might <hi>freely</hi> have forgiven the Sin of Man; but since, for the <hi>Glory</hi> of his <hi>Justice,</hi> he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to demand a Satisfaction that might be proportionable to the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb facs="tcp:205033:8"/>guilt of Sin, and the Contempt thereby offered to his Infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Holiness; if our Lord and Surety had been no more, than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and his unhappy Spawn <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> allowed him to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a mere <hi>naked Man,</hi> stript of Divinity, his Blood, though never so Innocent, must have been too <hi>cheap</hi> a Sacrifice for Sin. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us, <hi>God hath purchased his Church with his own Blood;</hi> i. e. with the Blood of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Person, who was <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man; Man,</hi> that he might have Blood to shed; and <hi>God,</hi> that his blood might be of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient value.</p>
            <p>Besides, they, who deny the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of our Lord and his Holy
<pb facs="tcp:205033:9"/>Spirit, whom we own and <hi>adore</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> do charge the whole <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church</hi> with <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and if so, if all they are counted Idolaters, who do Religiously wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship our Lord and his Spirit; this Lord of ours, and this Spirit of his, must in these Men's esteem be reckon'd <hi>Idols.</hi> And what Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy can be worse? What more damnable than this?</p>
            <p>And yet this Opinion, as bad as it is, amongst the croud of other Errors, is now revived amongst us, and to the shame of our Nation, the ruine of Souls, and for a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our gross Irreligion and foul Immoralities, is permitted to grow and spread. Now, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve my own little Flock from the Infection of this <hi>Pestilent Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>

            <head>THE DOCTRINE OF THE <hi>Glorious Trinity,</hi> NOT Explained, but Asserted.</head>
            <p>IT is our great misfortune to live in this unhappy and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Age, wherein the Ancient and <hi>Apostolical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is reduced almost to a perfect <hi>Anarchy;</hi> in so much that Men of corrupted Minds have took occasion from a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Liberty,</hi> allowed in favour to tender Consciences, to vent and spread several <hi>erroneous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and some <hi>damnable Doctrines,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:205033:11"/>whereby they have already se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and are very like eternally to ruine, a great Number of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and too credulous Souls.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that the Heresies of <hi>Arius, Sabellius, Macedonius, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and their Abetters, are more dangerous, and consequently more to be abhorred, than any of those Errors, which are taught by the Roman Church, which are said, <hi>Fundamentum tangere,</hi> to touch and strike at the Foundation of our Christian Faith, and that is bad enough; but the fore-named He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, which deny the Divinity of Christ and his Holy Spirit, the Trinity of Persons in the Glorious Godhead, and our Lord's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Father's Infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for the sin of Man, do <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum tollere,</hi> quite subvert and root up the main Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Faith, and that is a great deal worse.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Heresies</hi> are justly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with some tincture of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism;</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:205033:11"/>for, though the Defenders of them do <hi>acknowledge</hi> a <hi>God,</hi> yet they <hi>contract</hi> and limit the <hi>Deity,</hi> by denying it in the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Persons,</hi> in whom it doth as <hi>really</hi> and as <hi>certainly</hi> subsist, as in the <hi>First.</hi> Now, amongst the croud of Hetrodox Opinions, which, since the late variety of our Civil Revolutions, through the great Indulgence of our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, have been broached and spread amongst us; these Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Heresies, long since very just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned by the Catholick Church, have crept in, and found entertainment amongst such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as make, not the Word of God, but humane Reason, the Ground of their Faith.</p>
            <p>These abominable Heresies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus revived by Men, who bear and engross to themselves the Name of <hi>Ʋnitarians,</hi> as a mark of distinction, as if other Men, who own the <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> did not also own the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205033:12"/>
               <hi>God;</hi> several Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Persons of <hi>great Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>excellent Parts,</hi> both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and acquired, have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>explain</hi> this Mysterious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to <hi>acquit</hi> it from those Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, Contradictions, and that Impossibility; with all which it stands unjustly charged by its Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers.</p>
            <p>But although these several Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications were very piously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by their respective Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; I mean, to render this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse Doctrine the more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible and easie to the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Men, to remove all Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples about it, and to obviate all Exceptions against it; yet it is too evident, that these Explications have not yet obtained any happy Success; and it is to be feared, that they never will attain that blessed End, for which they were designed. For,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:205033:12"/> 1. These Explications of this Doctrine, were they never so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and satisfactory in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to learned Persons; yet illiterate Men, who are the far greater part of Mankind, and do most need the plainest Instructions, can never receive any benefit from them; for, these Explications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of nice distinctions, and dressed up in Logical, Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and Scholastick Terms; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Men, who are perfect strangers to such hard Notions, can never understand them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. These Explications of this Doctrine have not proved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and satisfactory to those learned Men, who have been, and still are its Opposers. For, they yet raise Objections against it, and still testifie as great a dislike of these Explications, as of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it self intended to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. Nay, they are so far from being satisfied, either with the Doctaine or its Explications,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:205033:13"/>that they have took occasion from the one to ridicule and scoff at both.</p>
            <p>For the blessed Trinity,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> p. 10.11.</note> as its Doctrine stands explained by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Men, is styled by way of Sarcasm and Irrision, The <hi>Cicero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> the <hi>Cartesian,</hi> the <hi>Platonick,</hi> and the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Trinity; as if this great Doctrine were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and could be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, not the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but the <hi>Schools.</hi> I am persuaded, that we had never heard of these and the like base Affronts and Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies against the Doctrine of the Trinity, had we never heard of such and such its Explications.</p>
            <p>That late Explication, written by an acute Divine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is, as its Author hath very learnedly proved, the very Sentiment of the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen;</hi> and he, that shall attempt to pen a better, hath very good luck, if he do not stumble upon a worse. And yet as plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:205033:13"/>as that Explication is, as being invented and approved by Men of great Abilities; yet amongst our modern <hi>Socinians</hi> it hath but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill Character indeed. It's true, they are so just as to commend the Judgment of that eminent Person, who collected it, telling us, <hi>That it is a true and Oxthodox Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what the Church intends to say;</hi> but as to the Explication it self, they presently brand it with the most ignominious Terms, and say, <hi>That it is a great Ʋntruth, a great piece of Non-sense, neither Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, nor Intelligible, nor Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Reproach most insufferable! A Remark most shamefully refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, not upon that learned <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> who only delivered the Sense of the Church; but upon the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of those ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> whose Authorities are cited by him; as if Sense and Reason, Learning and Divinity, were no where else to be found,
<pb facs="tcp:205033:14"/>save only in <hi>Socinus, Crellius, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopius,</hi> and their Abetters.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the Event of these late Explications, how well soever designed, hath proved no better; I think it may be wished, that they had been spared; and the rather, because they have not only exposed this great Doctrine of the blessed Trinity to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies and Contempt of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed <hi>Adversaries;</hi> but they have occasion'd hot Disputes, open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests, and bitter Animosities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt some of its known <hi>Friends.</hi> For, the Explications of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being very different, some of our own Divines, even Men of great Abilities and Reputation in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who do perfectly agree in the Truth and Substance of this Mysterious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, do as much disagree in its Explications.</p>
            <p>That so it is, we learn from that late and learned Book of <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,</hi> wherein one Divine hath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:205033:14"/>essectually overthrown the <hi>new Hypothesis</hi> of another; and too justly charg'd its Author, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of maintaining the <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Ʋnity,</hi> he had, by an unwary Expression, opened a gap for <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,</hi> the unhappy Brood of <hi>John Philoponus.</hi> It must be confessed that this Book of <hi>Animadversions</hi> was framed by a <hi>Rational Head,</hi> and written with a <hi>Golden Pen,</hi> but too deeply dipt in <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Gall;</hi> a Book, which, I think, had been much more <hi>commendable,</hi> had it been much less <hi>Satyrical;</hi> at least considering that high Post, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Person so treated stands; and that the <hi>Tritheism,</hi> with which he is charged, might be charitably imputed to an <hi>over-sight,</hi> a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>slip</hi> of an inconsiderate Pen, since 'tis very far from being his avowed <hi>Profession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, alas! all Men cannot learn that curious Art, which the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatist commends, <hi>Parcere personis, dicere de vitiis,</hi> so to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205033:15"/>betwixt <hi>Crimes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> so to abstract the <hi>Fault</hi> from the <hi>Man,</hi> that commits it, as to censure the one, yet not expose the other; at least not in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est manner, not so far, as any Man's Envy can provoke, or Wit enable.</p>
            <p>Such sad Inconveniencies, and such deplorable Contests have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose from the Endeavours of Men to explain this Mysterious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which indeed can never be well explained.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed can we wonder that it should be so; for, 'tis just with God to blast the Attempts of Men, who make bold to peep within that Curtain, which he himself hath drawn; and to pry into those <hi>Arcana,</hi> those Matters, which he hath thought fit as yet to conceal from us. That we might direct our worship aright, it hath been the good Pleasure of God so far to reveal to us the Doctrine of the Trinity, as to assure us, <hi>quòd sit,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:205033:15"/>That there are indeed Three Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Persons in the Deity to be adored; but, <hi>quomodò sit,</hi> how it should be so, the Scriptures do not inform us; nor do they allow us, much less oblige us, curiously to enquire into it.</p>
            <p>'Tis well said by one of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. When God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any thing for a certain Truth, which the Reason of Man cannot readily comply with, if we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute the Matter with our selves or others, and demand, as the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did, <hi>How can this be?</hi> even such an Enquiry is a very shrewd Argument, that we believe it not. But although such and such revealed Truths may be far above the reach of humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings; yet when we have a clear Revelation for it, our own Reason doth oblige us to believe every thing to be a Truth, which that God, who cannot Lye, hath discovered as such, though we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205033:16"/>our selves cannot comprehend it.</p>
            <p>'Tis that we pretend to in some other Cases; for, the Doctrine of the Trinity is not the only Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our Christian Faith, which transcends the Apprehension of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reason; there are some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Truths, which confound and puzzle our Understndings as well as this; and yet we commonly pretend to believe them. The <hi>Creation</hi> of this glorious Fabrick of Heaven and Earth without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny praeexistent Matter, is a thing so contrary to Reason, that it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for an undoubted Maxim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the old Philosophers, <hi>Ex nihilo, nihil fit,</hi> of nothing, nothing can be made. And as for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> of the Dead, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Man judged it a thing so absolutely impossible, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached it to the learned Men of <hi>Athens,</hi> they called him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a mere Babler; and as for the Doctrine it self, the Text
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205033:16"/>saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they mocked, <hi>Maxime ridiculum putantes Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectionis mysterium,</hi> saith <hi>Lorinus;</hi> They thought the Mystery of the Resurrection, for such indeed it is, to be no better than a most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Fable.</p>
            <p>So did <hi>Celsus</hi> in <hi>Origen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Origen. contra Cels. l. 5. p. 240. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabrig.</note> where he thus demands, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; What Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once wholly corrupted, is in any capacity to be restored to its former Constitution? 'Tis that, saith he, which God <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, neither will do, nor can. And for that reason he styles our recourse to God's Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a most absurd Refuge; and so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily concludes, That the Doctrine of the Resurrection is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, abominable, and impossible.</p>
            <p>Nor was <hi>Celsus</hi> alone in this Opinion: for it was indeed the general Opinion of the most
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:205033:17"/>knowing Men in the Heathen World. <hi>Pliny,</hi> amongst other things, which he thought to be beyond the Power of God, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions these Two, <hi>Mortales aeterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate donare, vel revocare defunctos,</hi> To keep mortal Men from ever dying, or to revive them being dead. And of the latter <hi>Aeschylus</hi> thus concludes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Of a Man once dead there is no Resurrection.
<note place="margin">Tertul. de Resur. Carnis.</note> And <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, That this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>De una Omnium Philosopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Schola sumitur.</hi> Although the Immortality of Man's Soul was granted by many of the old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers; yet the Resurrection of a dead Body dissolved, corrupted, and crumbled into Dust, and that Dust dissipated, scattered, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled, was generally denied by them all, as being in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion an utter Impossibility.</p>
            <p>Now, though the Creation of the World out of Nothing, and I may add, the framing of Man's
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:205033:17"/>Body, so very curiously wrought, <hi>ex inhabili materia,</hi> out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward and unlikely matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unsuitable to such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and the Restitution of the same Body, though quite corrupted, out of the self-same Dust, though scatter'd and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled, of which it once consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though these Acts do puzzle the Reason of all Mankind, and that to such a degree, as to be thought impracticable, and that by Men of choice Parts, and the most approved Understandings; yet we of the Christian Church do acknowledge the Creation, as an Act already done; and the Resurrection, as an Act that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will be, as undoubted Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Creed.</p>
            <p>Tell me then, How come we to believe the Creation of the World, and the Resurrection of the dead, being things which have seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impossible to great numbers of other rational and learned Men?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:205033:18"/>Certain I am, that the Ground of our Faith in both these Cases can be nothing else, save only the written Word of God: For, we cannot think, without too much Arrogance, that our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in these later days of the World, are so much improved, as to be able merely by their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light to discover these Truths, and to baffle all Objections against them, with stronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and clearer Evidence, than other Mens Reason could do in former Ages.</p>
            <p>But it hath been the good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God in this last Age of the World to bless the Catholick Church with a Divine Revelation, and to tell us clearly, especially in his Gospel, That as he created the World in its beginning, so at its end he will raise the dead; and by virtue of such Testimonies we must think our selves obliged to believe both, even though we cannot resolve all Doubts, nor
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:205033:18"/>answer all Objections framed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst either. And if so, why should we not, by virtue of a like Warrant, believe the <hi>Trinity</hi> of Persons in the <hi>Godhead?</hi> 'Tis certain that <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and our Lord's <hi>Apostles,</hi> were all inspired Men; and since they were so, they are equally credible: Wherefore if we believe <hi>Moses,</hi> when he tells us,
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.1.</note>
               <hi>God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Heavens and the Earth;</hi> if we believe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he saith, <hi>There shall be a Resurrection both of the Just and the Ʋnjust;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 24.15.</note> Why should we not believe St. <hi>John,</hi> when he tells us,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.7.</note>
               <hi>There are Three that bear Record in Heaven?</hi> the Authority of which Text shall in due time, and a more proper place, be considered.</p>
            <p>Now, since a Divine Revelation is enough to silence all the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Humane Reason against any Truths that are Revealed, the best, and I think, the only way to confute all the Cavils of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:205033:19"/>
               <hi>Socinians</hi> against the Doctrine of the blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> is, not to attempt an Explanation of the <hi>manner</hi> how these glorious Persons are distinguished, but by <hi>Sacred Writ</hi> to prove their <hi>number,</hi> and the <hi>certainty</hi> of their distinction. And were this once effectually done; were the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead</hi> consistent with, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> clearly demonstrated even to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Capacities by infallible Texts of Scripture, the <hi>Socinian</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of <hi>Impossibility</hi> must cease for ever. For it is an old Rule and a true one, <hi>Frustrà quaeritur de posse, cùm constat de esse;</hi> When once 'tis evident, that any thing certainly is so or so, it were prodigious Folly to enquire any more, whether it might be so. For 'tis another Rule, <hi>Quicquid est in Actu, fuit in Potentia;</hi> Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is in present actual Being, must needs be granted to have been in a former Capacity to be that which now it is.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:205033:19"/>
            <p> And upon this Consideration, had those worthy Men who have endeavoured to discover the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> how the Three Glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> though they are but <hi>One God,</hi> do yet stand really distinguished from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; had they, I say, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their great Abilities in proving the <hi>certainty</hi> of their Distinction, they had, I think, more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally baffled the Opposers of this great Doctrine, and thereby done far better Service to the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>If it be said, That this Work is happily done already; That the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> hath been sufficiently proved by several learned Men in several Ages, and so needs no further Proofs: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, for the same reason it needs no new <hi>Explications</hi> neither: For, have not the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen</hi> already explained it as well as any <hi>other Man</hi> can hope to do? But withal, so long as there shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:205033:20"/>a new <hi>Donatus</hi> or <hi>Pelagius,</hi> there will be need enough of a new St. <hi>Austin:</hi> If there start up another <hi>Arius,</hi> there is need enough of another <hi>Athanasius</hi> too: So long as there shall be <hi>new Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers</hi> of our Faith, it should have <hi>new Defenders.</hi> When <hi>old Heresies</hi> are revived, the <hi>old Arguments</hi> must be refreshed, and newly muster'd up against them.</p>
            <p>Now, since this is the present and very unhappy Case of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> since old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, long since condemned by the Catholick Church, are now crept in amongst us, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Men who bear a new Name; who, because there can be but <hi>One God,</hi> deny the Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> and charge the Doctrine of it with Contradictions, I shall endeavour, by the Divine Assistance, to make good this Doctrine, as to its <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Certainty.</hi>

            <p> To this end the use of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Arguments</hi> from Humane Discourse, ordinary <hi>Topicks,</hi> and Logical Conclusions, save only such as are founded in, and drawn from the Word of God, would be vain; for the Reason of Man of it self can never afford us any solid Proofs to confirm such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, the Contents whereof do infinitely transcend its utmost Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. We find indeed, that Men, who are loath to believe what they cannot comprehend, have employed their Understandings to find out such Arguments in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to these mysterious Truths, which mere natural Reason, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some higher Light, doth scarce know how to answer.</p>
            <p>Were it my present Business to prove the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, it were easie to produce Arguments from a great variety of Topicks; as from the Creation of the World, from the Usefulness, Beauty, and Order of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:205033:21"/>from the regular Motions of the Sun, Moon, and Stars; from the constant Succession of Night and Day, Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter; from the universal Consent of Nations; from the Faculties of the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul; from the secret Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Conscience, and from the Fears and Hopes of dying Men. And since God is <hi>Ens necessarium,</hi> a necessary Being, <hi>Primus motor,</hi> the first Mover, and original Cause of all created Beings, we may thence by Discourse, and the strength of natural Reason infer his Unity.</p>
            <p>But when we are to prove a <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> there is but one way to do it, and that is by <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> by the Testimony of that God, who alone doth perfectly know his own Being, whatsoever is in it, and belongs unto it. True it is, this Doctrine of a <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> being first revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:205033:21"/>some things in <hi>Nature</hi> have been thought to be weak <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,</hi> and imperfect Resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it. As for instance; there is in the Sun, Light, Heat, and Influence; Three distinct things, and yet but One Sun; there is in the Soul of Man an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, a Will, and a Memory; the Soul of Man hath a Power of Reason, Sense, and Vegetation, Three distinct Faculties, and yet the Soul is but One. But, alas! these <hi>Similitudes</hi> are not <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> they are not used as <hi>Grounds</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> but only as <hi>Illustrations</hi> to facilitate our Belief, and render it somewhat the easier. There is nothing found in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that can demonstrate the <hi>certainty</hi> of a <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Ʋnity;</hi> but these faint Resemblances are made use of to assist our Reason, and help our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in apprehending its <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:205033:22"/>
            <p> Now that this Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> of Persons in the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of the Godhead, is not only <hi>possible,</hi> but certainly <hi>true,</hi> I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to evince against our Modern <hi>Socinians,</hi> who are the unhappy Spawn of the ancient <hi>Ebionites, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellians,</hi> and <hi>Arians,</hi> by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God, recorded in the Holy Scriptures, as they have been expounded by those pious and learned Men, who are deservedly esteemed the most judicious <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> the ablest <hi>Interpreters,</hi> and the choicest <hi>Defenders</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith.</p>
            <p>To prove the certainty of this great Doctrine I shall use Three sorts of Texts. 1. Such Texts as in the Judgment of many learned Men, do import a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Persons, or more distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences than One in the Deity. 2. Such Texts as do restrain and limit this Plurality of Persons to the number of <hi>Three,</hi> no more, no less. 3. Such Texts, as do
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:205033:22"/>prove <hi>each</hi> of these <hi>Three</hi> distinct <hi>Persons,</hi> singly consider'd in his own <hi>Hypostasis</hi> or <hi>Subsistence,</hi> to be God; so called, not <hi>Metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as our <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it, but in the most <hi>proper,</hi> strict, and usual Sense of that Notion, as it imports a Being Eternal, Immense, Omnipotent, Omniscient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There are several Texts, some of which do very <hi>probably,</hi> and some very <hi>certainly,</hi> import a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Persons, or distinct Subsistences in the ever-blessed Godhead.</p>
            <p>So do several judicious Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the very first Verse of our Bible, as if it had been the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Almighty God to give his Church a very early Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this mysterious Doctrine, which was more clearly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in after-Ages. The Text runs thus:
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.1.</note>
               <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth.</hi> God, so we read it: But 'tis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:205033:23"/>in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> So saith the Original; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exactly translated, must be rendred thus: <hi>The Gods created.</hi> But are there more <hi>Gods</hi> than <hi>One,</hi> who had an hand in this great work of Creation? if not, Why is the only Creator here expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a Noun of the <hi>Plural</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? <hi>Pererius</hi> answers, That this Expression intimates, <hi>Divinarum Personarum Multitudinem;</hi> So he; and <hi>Munster</hi> thus, <hi>Insinuatur ab ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordio Scripturae in Deo esse &amp; Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitatem &amp; Ʋnitatem:</hi> And so <hi>Fagius,</hi> who delivers it as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of many other Divines; for thus he tells us, <hi>Nostri hinc colligunt Trinitatis Mysterium, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem personarum è nomine Elohim, Ʋnitatem Substantiae ex adjuncto verbo singulari.</hi> From this Text do our Divines collect the Mystery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> from the Noun <hi>Plural</hi> a <hi>distinction</hi> of Persons, and from the Verb <hi>singular</hi> joined with it, the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of Essence.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:205033:23"/>
            <p> From the same Text doth St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that great Luminary of the Christian Church, infer the Second Person in the Trinity: For his Words are these: <hi>Personam filii evidenter ostendit;</hi> This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression doth evidently shew the Person of God the Son: For whereas 'tis said, <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth,</hi> this great Man doth thus demand, <hi>Quem alium Principium intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum putamus, nisi filium?</hi> Whom else can we here understand by this Word <hi>Beginning</hi> but the Son? This Interpretation, which refers not to the <hi>Time,</hi> but to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of the Creation, is much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by that which is given by the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which translates the first Words of the Verse, not <hi>In Principio,</hi> In the <hi>Beginning,</hi> but <hi>In sapientia,</hi> In, or by <hi>Wisdom;</hi> and under that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many Christian Writers have ascribed it to our blessed Saviour, the Second Person in the Trinity;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:205033:24"/>being, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>The Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, by whom he made the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly St. <hi>Augustine</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where tells us:
<note place="margin">Aug. de Gen. ad Lit. l. 1. cap. 6.</note>
               <hi>In ipso exordio in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choatae Creaturae Trinitas insinuatur Creatoris.</hi> In the very first menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Creation there is a fair Intimation of our Creator's Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for when <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>In the beginning God made Heaven and Earth: Intelligimus Patrem in Dei nomine, &amp; in Principii nomine Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium.</hi> By the Word <hi>God,</hi> we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Father;</hi> and by the Word <hi>Beginning,</hi> we understand the <hi>Son;</hi> and since the next Verse mentions the Spirit of God, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletam commemorationem Trinitatis agnoscimus;</hi> We own it as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat account of the Trinity: So thought this ancient and learned Father.</p>
            <p>But there is another Verse in the same Chapter, which is, and well may be urged to prove a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Persons in the Deity;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205033:24"/>where <hi>Moses</hi> brings in God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty speaking thus,
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note>
               <hi>Let us make Man.</hi> Great St. <hi>Basil</hi> here puts this Question,
<note place="margin">Basil. M. in Hex. Hom. 9.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Is there but <hi>One</hi> single Person here mentioned and concerned in the Creation of Man? Doubtless there must be <hi>Two</hi> at least; the Person <hi>speaking,</hi> and the Person or Persons <hi>spoke</hi> unto. But the Question is, saith <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Athan. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. 3. de Trin. pag. (mihi) 224.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; To <hi>whom</hi> did God say, <hi>Let us make Man?</hi> To this Question there are Four An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers given.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is mention made by <hi>Munster</hi> of one <hi>Moses Gerundensis,</hi> whose Opinion it was, that God Almighty spake these Words, <hi>Let us make Man,</hi> to the <hi>Earth;</hi> as if God and the Earth, as <hi>Co-workers,</hi> made Man betwixt them; the <hi>Earth</hi> his Body, and God his Soul.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed rightly tells us,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.47.</note>
               <hi>The first Man is of the Earth,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:205033:25"/>Earthy,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, made of the Earth. But though he was made of the Earth, yet he was not made by the Earth: For <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord God formed Man of the Dust of the Ground.</hi> The Earth did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed contain in it the Materials of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body, but contributed nothing towards its <hi>Frame:</hi> There was not in the Earth any Active Principle that could enable it to transmute its own Dust into Flesh, Blood, Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There was not in the Earth any such <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, such a formative Vertue, as could any way tend towards the Composure of such a curious and most admirable piece of Work, as the Body of Man most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is; For so intimates the Psalmist, where he saith,
<note place="margin">Ps 139.14.</note>
               <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Acu pictus sum;</hi> My Body is so curiously wrought, as if it were embroidered by the Work of a Needle: And if so, could the dull Earth do this? it could no more <hi>quicken</hi> or <hi>frame
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205033:25"/>Adam</hi>'s Body, than it can now <hi>restore</hi> or <hi>revive</hi> its dead.</p>
            <p>No; in the Creation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body the Earth was wholy <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi> as indeed all other Matter is, of which any Artist makes such or such a Vessel; the whole Work was God's, and done by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power: For, if it were a Miracle in <hi>Egypt</hi> for Dust to be turned into Lice, then certainly for Dust to be turned into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Man, of an erect stature, consisting of various Members, artificially placed in a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Order, can be no less.</p>
            <p>Now, if it would be perfect Folly for any Workman to say to his Materials, <hi>Let us make such or such a thing,</hi> What reason hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man to think, that God should say to the Earth, <hi>Let us make Man?</hi> 'Tis certain, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty could not want any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance towards the Creation of Man; and 'tis as certain, that if he had needed any help, the Earth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:205033:26"/>could have yielded him none. So that this first Opinion deserves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be <hi>exploded</hi> with <hi>Contempt,</hi> as being ridiculous, than to be <hi>confuted</hi> by <hi>Arguments,</hi> as if there were any shew of Reason and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second Opinion about this matter is this; some have thought, that when God said, <hi>Let us make Man,</hi> he spake of and to <hi>Himself,</hi> according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Custom of the <hi>Kings</hi> and Princes of this World; who, to shew their Power, Majesty, and Distinction from other Men, are commonly wont to speak of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, though but <hi>single</hi> Persons, in the <hi>Plural</hi> number.</p>
            <p>But this Opinion is a meer Conjecture, for which there is no Ground; 'tis indeed a frivolous pretence first imagined by such Persons as were Enemies to the Divinity of Christ, and would fain exclude him from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Text, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205033:26"/>from having any Hand in the Creation of Man. 'Tis indeed the usual Style of <hi>Earthly Kings</hi> and Princes to speak of themselves in the <hi>Plural</hi> number; to say, <hi>We, Ʋs,</hi> and <hi>Our:</hi> But this is not the usual Style of <hi>Almighty God:</hi> For amongst those thousands of Texts, wherein God speaks of himself, there are but <hi>Five</hi> to be found, wherein he doth not speak in the <hi>Singular</hi> number.</p>
            <p>'Tis observed, that the Kings of this World, to shew their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority and Dominion over their Subjects, do speak of themselves in the Plural number at no time so much, as when they send forth their <hi>Royal Edicts</hi> and <hi>Proclamations;</hi> their common Style then runs thus, <hi>We Command; 'Tis Our Royal Will and Pleasure.</hi> And certainly if it had been the Pleasure of God to display his Glory, and to shew his absolute and universal Dominion after the same manner, he would have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:205033:27"/>done it, when there was most occasion for it; I mean, when he came to prescribe and proclaim his <hi>Royal Law.</hi> But this he did not do; for <hi>Moses</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Exod. 20.1</note>
               <hi>God spake these Words and said;</hi> but what did he say? And how did he style himself? Why thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>I am the Lord?</hi> 'Tis not <hi>We,</hi> in the <hi>Plural,</hi> but <hi>I,</hi> in the <hi>singular</hi> number. And since God, to shew his Majesty, did not use this manner of Speech, when there was the greatest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for it, we may easily think, that he did not use it to that end, when there was far less Reason, if any at all.</p>
            <p>But methinks this fond Cavil should not be so much as pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to elude another Text, where God speaks after the same manner; <hi>Behold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.22.</note>
               <hi>the Man is become as one of Ʋs:</hi> Here again God was pleased to speak of himself in the <hi>Plural</hi> number; but why so? 'tis very seldom that he doth it, and why then here? There was now no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:205033:27"/>occasion for him to shew the greatness of his Majesty, like the Kings of this World, by a form of Speech, common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to them, but to him very unusual. No, St. <hi>Basil</hi> hath left us another, and a far better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it than this; for thus he saith,
<note place="margin">Basil. M. adversus Eunom. l. 5. p. 132.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. 'Tis evident, that God doth not here speak of himself, as of <hi>one</hi> single person only; but he speaks of himself in the Plural number, for this Reason, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. That we might understand, that together with himself he reckon'd his Son and his Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>But there is yet another Branch of this Opinion, as if God spake these Words, <hi>Let Ʋs make Man,</hi> not only <hi>of</hi> himself in the <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> number, with a design to display his Glory, but <hi>to</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone. With this Opinion, St. <hi>Basil</hi> in his afore-named Book doth charge the <hi>Jews,</hi> who asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:205033:28"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, That God did here discourse in a Soliloquy with himself alone. This Opinion that learned Man deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly thought to be very absurd, and such a Practice to be seldom or never seen; for thus he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. What Smith, what Carpenter, what Shoemaker, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alone amongst his Tools, and having no other Man to work with him, doth even speak to himself, and say, Let <hi>us</hi> make a <hi>Sword,</hi> a <hi>Plow,</hi> a <hi>Shoe?</hi> as that Father there goeth on. And if this Practice be a thing unusal, and would be thought but foolish amongst Men, we cannot without Blasphemy ascribe the same thing to God. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Third Opinion about this Matter is this; namely, That when God said, <hi>Let Ʋs make Man,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:205033:28"/>he spake these Words to his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;</hi> as if those blessed Spirits had an Hand in our Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>With this Opinion also doth great St. <hi>Basil</hi> charge the <hi>Jews,</hi> who say, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<note place="margin">Basil. M. in Hex. Hom. 9.</note> God spake these Words to <hi>many</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, even the <hi>Angels</hi> that stood round about him. The same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> charge them with:
<note place="margin">Chrysosto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in Gen. 1.26.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; The <hi>Jews</hi> say, That God spake these Words to some of his <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Archangels.</hi> And why they said so, St. <hi>Basil</hi> tells us,

            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:205033:29"/>
            <p> St. <hi>Basil</hi> calls this Opinion, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>Jewish</hi> Fiction, and St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in detestation of it, breaks out after his Rhetorical manner; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; O the madness! O the great Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of these <hi>Jews!</hi> For when God said, <hi>Let Ʋs make Man after our own Image,</hi> 'tis evident, that he spake to some Persons, whose I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was the self-same with his own; but that cannot be said of <hi>Angels.</hi> For, as St. <hi>Basil</hi> demands, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Is the Image of God and Angels One and the same? No, 'tis St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s peremptory Assertion,
<note place="margin">Aug. de Civ. Dei l. 16. cap. 6.</note>
               <hi>Nefas est credere ad Imaginem Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum hominem esse factum, aut ean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem esse Imaginem Angelorum &amp; Dei;</hi> To believe that Man was made after the Image of Angels; or that the Image of God and Angels is the same, 'tis no less than sin.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:205033:29"/>
            <p> For the Scriptures do every where ascribe the Creation of Man, not to <hi>Angels,</hi> but to <hi>God</hi> alone; and of him 'tis said, <hi>He</hi> Created, not <hi>They,</hi> importing God and Angels; but in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, <hi>He,</hi> importing none but God: 'Tis said again, <hi>God created Man,</hi> not in <hi>Their</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, but <hi>his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, from the Authority of this and other Texts we may safely conclude, That this Speech of God, <hi>Let Ʋs make Man after our own Image,</hi> could not be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Angels;</hi> the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion being, as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> well styles it, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>This was the General Opinion of the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of the

               </gap>, to whom else did God speak these Words, but to him who is the Angel of his great Counsel, his wonderful Fellow-Counsellor, the Potentate, even the only begotten Son of God?

            <p>The Testimony of this Text I shall conclude with that Expression of <hi>Elias Cretensis, Verba illa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Elias Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis in Nazian. or. 1. pag. 213.</note>
               <hi>faciamus hominem, filium cum Patre Creato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem esse ostendunt;</hi> Those Words of God, <hi>Let Ʋs make Man,</hi> do shew, that the <hi>Son,</hi> together with the <hi>Father,</hi> was Man's Creator. So that in the Judgment of these learned Men whom I have cited, this Text doth prove the thing for which I brought it, I mean a <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> of Persons in the ever-blessed Godhead.</p>
            <p>But had these Authorities been insufficient, I might have added more; and particularly that of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who expresly saith,
<note place="margin">Tert. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus Praxeam. cap. 12.</note> That God Almighty was pleased
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:205033:32"/>in this Text, <hi>Let Ʋs make Man,</hi> to speak of himself in the <hi>Plural</hi> number; for this reason, <hi>Quia jam adhaerebat illi filius, secunda Persona; &amp; Tertia, Spiritus;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Son and his Spirit, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and a Third Person, were already, before the Creation of Man, closely united to him.</p>
            <p>And now from these and the like Testimonies we may learn what was the Judgment of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers about the Sense of this Text, <hi>Let Ʋs make Man,</hi> and of the intention of God in it; they did not imagine, that God here, or any where else, spake of himself in. the <hi>Plural</hi> number to shew his <hi>Majesty,</hi> as the Kings of this World are now wont to do: Nor did they think that God spake these Words to <hi>Himself</hi> alone, as one <hi>single</hi> Person, or to his <hi>Angels,</hi> who were then about him; these Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are only the Dreams of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who are glad of any pretence to escape the force of all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:205033:32"/>such Texts, which in opposition to their great Error, do evince and prove a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Glorious Persons in the Godhead, of which number this Text is one, if we may rely upon the Judgment of those ancient and very learned <hi>Fathers,</hi> who, writing with more Reason, and less Prejudice, are much more to be valued than <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Socinians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since our <hi>Socinians,</hi> to prove that God is but One, draw an Argument from the First Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which runs thus, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods before me;</hi> Or as it is in our Liturgy, <hi>But me.</hi> Since they from the Pronoun <hi>Me,</hi> being of the <hi>Singular</hi> number, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Unity of the <hi>Godhead;</hi> why might not the Fathers, as indeed they do, from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun <hi>Ʋs,</hi> infer the Plurality of <hi>Persons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> are not satisfied with these or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Texts out of the Old
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:205033:33"/>Testament, which they interpret another, though far more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, way; the <hi>Jews,</hi> who quite cashiere the whole New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, must be left under their present Judicial blindness; but for the conviction of such as believe the Gospel, and yet question this great Doctrine of the Trinity, I shall thence produce a Text or two, which prove a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Deity, with as clear Evidence as any Words can give.</p>
            <p>The Texts which I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, were penned by St. <hi>John;</hi> to whose Gospel I shall at present confine my self; not for want of other Testimonies, but because St. <hi>John</hi> wrote his Gospel purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confirm the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ; and the occasion of his doing so was this: In the time of his Banishment and Absence from his Flock, certain pestilent Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies were crept into the Church, and particularly that of <hi>Cerinthus</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:205033:33"/>and <hi>Ebion,</hi> a Man who asserted, That our Lord was conceived and born, as all other Men are; That he had a Man for his Father, as well as a Woman for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; That before his Birth from <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> he had no being, and consequently that he was not God.</p>
            <p>Now, to stifle this damnable Heresie, like a deadly Cockatrice, in the Egg, and to prevent its future growth, St. <hi>John,</hi> as an ancient Author tells us,
<note place="margin">Prafat. in ad Aug. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos. in Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunis E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium.</note>
               <hi>Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus ab Episcopis Asiae de Coaeterna Patri Divinitate Christi scripsit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus Haereticos, qui Christum ante Mariam fuisse negabant.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> being importuned by the Bishops of <hi>Asia,</hi> wrote his Gospel against those Hereticks, who denied that Christ had any being, till he was born of <hi>Mary;</hi> and in this Gospel, to the confusion of those Hereticks, he hath delivered the Doctrine of Christ's <hi>Divinity,</hi> as being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal with God his Father.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:205033:34"/>
            <p> The like Story is recorded by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> though with some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Circumstances; for, of St. <hi>John</hi> he speaks thus,

               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; St. <hi>John</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the other Evangelists, who had wrote before him, had delivered the History of Christ, especially as it related to his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and the Actions done therein, being so exhorted by his Friends, and moved by the Spirit of God, wrote a Spiritual Gospel; and that, as the same Historian saith elsewhere,
<note place="margin">Euseb Hist. Eccles. l. 3. cap. 24.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, beginning his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel with the Doctrine of our Lord's Divinity. And why the delivering of this great Doctrine was by the blessed Spirit of God reserved for St. <hi>John,</hi> and not committed to the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, the Historian hath left us this Account; namely, That the clear
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:205033:34"/>Revelation of our Lord's Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was left to St. <hi>John,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as to one that was better, as being what he is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Christ's <hi>bosom</hi> Friend, and more beloved than any of the other Apostles.</p>
            <p>Now, since this beloved Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the Inspiration of God, wrote his Gospel on purpose to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the Heresie of <hi>Ebion</hi> and his Followers, who asserted, That our blessed Redeemer was but a meer Man, and nothing more; we have all reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that those usual Texts which are cited out of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel as pregnant Proofs of our Lord's Divinity, were intended as such by the Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> who <hi>dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and by the <hi>Evangelist</hi> himself, who wrote them.</p>
            <p>The first of these Proofs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the very first Verse of this Gospel, which runs thus;
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.1.</note>
               <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> and <hi>the Word was with God,</hi> and <hi>the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:205033:35"/>Word was God;</hi> a Text so express, that it cannot be fairly interpreted any other way, nor without much violence wrested to any other Sense, save only that wherein the Assertours of our Lord's <hi>Divine Nature</hi> do generally understand it.</p>
            <p>Why our blessed Saviour is here called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Word,</hi> I am not now concerned to enquire: And that his Sacred Person is certainly meant by the <hi>Word,</hi> I need not stand to prove, because I think that the <hi>Socinians</hi> themselves do generally grant it. And indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the subsequent Verses in the Context, they cannot without shame deny it, nor with any shew of Reason so much as doubt it.</p>
            <p>Now, 'tis said of this Word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, He <hi>was;</hi> 'tis not said, He was <hi>made,</hi> or <hi>created,</hi> but He <hi>was,</hi> He had a Being, and that <hi>In the beginning</hi>

            <p>The Text goeth on, and tells us, <hi>The Word was with God,</hi> where by that known Rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; we must understand that the <hi>Word was with God in the beginning,</hi> and since he was, 'tis well observed by <hi>Clarius, Ecce Personarum distinctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem:</hi> Here we may see the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Divine Persons; for, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> rightly argueth,

               <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitantèr alius ostenditur, qui fuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit à Principio, alius apud quem fuit;</hi> without all doubt, he that was with God, is thereby shewed to be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:205033:36"/>one Person, and that God, with whom he was, is another; for 'tis not imaginable, that the Evangelist should mean that One Person was with himself.</p>
            <p>And as this Expression, <hi>The Word was with God,</hi> doth necessarily imply a <hi>distinction</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> so doth the next Clause as necessarily import an <hi>Identity</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> for 'tis expresly said, <hi>The Word was God;</hi> though a distinct Person, yet One and the same God. And this is yet farther evident from our Lord's own Mouth; for thus he saith,
<note place="margin">Joh. 10.30.</note>
               <hi>I and my Father are One.</hi> These Words, <hi>I and my Father,</hi> do undeniably prove the <hi>distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of their <hi>Persons;</hi> and whereas he saith, <hi>I and my Father are One,</hi> that clearly sheweth the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of their <hi>Essence.</hi> 'Tis not said in the Masculine Gender, <hi>I and my Father are</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, One Person; but in the Neuter, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I and my Father are One <hi>thing;</hi> and if that thing be not the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> they cannot
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:205033:36"/>be <hi>One.</hi> For, since the <hi>Father</hi> is confessed to be <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>One</hi> thing with him, unless he be <hi>God</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And in this Sense, according to the genuine Construction of the Words did our Saviour's Hearers rightly understand this Speech of his; for when our Lord had said, <hi>I and my Father are One;</hi> the Evangelist tells us in the very next Verse, <hi>Then the Jews took up Stones again to stone him,</hi> and gave this Reason for it; <hi>We stone thee for Blasphemy, because thou, being a Man, makest thy self God.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> took his meaning right, and were satisfied, that when he said, <hi>I and my Father are One,</hi> he made himself <hi>God;</hi> and indeed so he was, and his Words do so clearly import it, that if he had not been God, for this Speech of his he had deserved to die.</p>
            <p>I know that our <hi>Socinians,</hi> to elude the force of these Words, which make so much against them, do find themselves concerned to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:205033:37"/>interpret them another way, as if their meaning were this, <hi>I and my Father are One; i.</hi> say they, there is, <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">Joh. 10.28, 29.</note> for, having said, <hi>No Man shall pluck my Sheep out of my Hand:</hi> And again, <hi>No Man is able to pluck them out of my Father's Hand;</hi> he gave us an Intimation that his Sheep were equally safe in his <hi>Father</hi>'s Hand, and in his <hi>own</hi> too; and then immediately sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned this Reason for it, <hi>I and my Father are One;</hi> but in what Respects are they One?

            <p>But yet we have reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that those Texts of the Old Testament, which are now urged as Arguments to prove the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> were not understood, at least not so well, by the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> as now they are by us.

            <p>And a pregnant Instance of this we have in our present Case; whereas the Evangelical Prophet tells us,

               </gap>, this three-fold repetition of the Word <hi>Holy,</hi> do the ancient Fathers and Modern Divines infer the Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Godhead, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly too.</p>

            <p>Now the Question is, What moved these and other learned Men thus to interpret this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Text, and to conclude from it the Doctrine of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Cornelius à Lapide</hi> tells us,

And because this mysterious point of Faith is so very difficult to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reason, that some deny it, and others doubt it; 'tis necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that such Evidences should be produced for it, as may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Minds of impartial, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced, and reasonable Men.</p>
            <p>But to satisfie the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Men about this matter, no Arguments can be sufficient, save only such as are drawn from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and clear Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And altho' it be a difficult Task to produce any fairer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to prove the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> than those already named out of the <hi>Old Testament;</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:205033:45"/>yet we find good Store of them in the <hi>New.</hi> Our Lord himself by his Evangelists and Apostles hath furnished us with such Proofs, as no Man, who dares not offer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to such and such Texts, can ever gainsay. It's true, Men who make the Sacred Scriptures the <hi>Subject</hi> of their <hi>Drollery</hi> rather than the <hi>Grounds</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Rules</hi> of their <hi>Manners:</hi> Men of corrupted Brains and wanton Wits may, if they please, by unwarrantable Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and false Interpretations, seemingly elude and enervate the force of the plainest Texts: But whosoever is of a sober, meek, and teachable Spirit, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is not unalterably wedded to his present Opinion, as Men are to their present Wives, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad, may find in the New Testament such evident Proofs of the blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> as are sufficient to fix and settle his Judgment in the firm belief of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:205033:46"/>this great and necessary Point of Faith.</p>
            <p>And if we do indeed believe the whole Gospel to be the infallible Word of that God who cannot lie, grant we must, That any one clear and undoubted Testimony of our Evangelists or Apostles were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, though we had no more, to confirm any Article of our Creed, even such as are the most difficult to Humane Reason; God's <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">Tert. adv. Prax. cap. 27. p. 516.</note> so it was in <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s time, who mentions it as their common Custom, <hi>Ter mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitamur,</hi> We are dipped three times; so he.</p>
            <p>Nay, this threefold Dipping was required with the greatest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity by the Apostle's Canons;

            <p>But there is another Reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, which is to my present purpose;
<note place="margin">Zon. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post. Can. 5</note>

<note place="margin">Basil. M. de Sp. S.</note>
               <hi>Basil</hi> seems to add a threefold Supplication, to each Person of the Trinity One; for thus he writes, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, The great Mystery of Baptism is perfectly performed by <hi>Three Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersions,</hi> and an equal number of <hi>Invocations:</hi> By which he proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly means <hi>one</hi> Prayer to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> a <hi>Second</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> and a <hi>Third</hi> to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> begging their joynt Blessings upon their own joynt Institution.</p>

            <p> Now then, since in this prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Form of Baptism, the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented as <hi>Three Persons</hi> of equal capacity to <hi>institute</hi> this Sacrament, and to be <hi>worshipped</hi> by it; since it is not reasonable to imagine, that our Lord would here have joyned himself and his Spirit to his Father, as Persons co-ordinate with him, had they not indeed been his Equals. And since it hath been the practice of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament, to name and invoke each of these sacred Persons; we have all reason to conclude, that this Form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> doth indeed contain and prove the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Distinction</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> and <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of <hi>Essence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the truth is, were the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> in whose Name we are baptized, no more than
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:205033:51"/>Creatures, our Lord's Form of Baptism would not be of much better account than that of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion;</hi> who baptized, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> In the Name of the unknown Father of the Universe, of the Verity, the Mother of all things, and of him who descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Jesus. For if to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the Worship of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be to be baptized into down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and gross Idolatry, whether the Institution were from <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Marcion,</hi> it would make no difference. Nor do I see how those Persons who will not allow this Form of Baptism to be a proof of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> can discharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from Blasphemy against our blessed Saviour, not only by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> his <hi>Divinity,</hi> but also by charging him with the Institution of a new Sacrament in the name and for the Worship of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for such it is, if their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

               </gap>; That there are <hi>Three</hi> that bear Record, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>Blood;</hi> to which St. <hi>Cyril</hi> adds, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> cites him, <hi>Hi tres unum sunt;</hi> These <hi>Three</hi> are <hi>One.</hi> The Truth of this we grant. But,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:205033:54"/> 2. We answer, That the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, wherein this Text is found, as now it stands, are more in number, and of <hi>greater Credit,</hi> if we may believe Tradition, than those Copies wherein this Text is either <hi>omitted</hi> or altered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Estius,</hi> a learned Interpreter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Epistle, tells us, and cites an Author for it, That of <hi>Sixteen</hi> ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, which were brought together from <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain, Seven</hi> wanted this Text, and <hi>Nine</hi> had it. But because the disparity betwixt <hi>Seven</hi> and <hi>Nine</hi> is not so very considerable, he farther tells us, That of a <hi>great number</hi> of Manuscript Copies that were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together by the Divines of <hi>Lovain,</hi> there were but <hi>Five</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Text was wanting. And an eminent Divine of our own Church, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, now with God, being famous as well for his great Piety as for the depth of his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath left us this Testimony; namely, that this disputed Text,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:205033:54"/>as it is now read in our Bibles, hath the Authority of <hi>many</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and <hi>All</hi> printed Copies but <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if from these Instances we may take an Estimate of the difference betwixt those Copies, which have this Text, and those which want it in point of <hi>number;</hi> the <hi>Majority</hi> of Voices will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be on our side, and that doth always carry the Cause, at least where the most Testimonies are of <hi>equal,</hi> but much more where they are of greater <hi>Credit</hi> than the <hi>fewest;</hi> and that is the present Case.</p>
            <p>For according to the old Rule, <hi>Quod Antiquissimum, Verissimum:</hi> Those Copies which are most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, are supposed to be of the greatest Credit; and those <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> who lived nearest to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, as they are the more <hi>venerable</hi> for their <hi>Antiquity,</hi> so are they the less <hi>liable</hi> to any <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion</hi> of <hi>Partiality</hi> in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:205033:55"/>much less of <hi>Fraud</hi> and Forgery, and that in a Case which needed none.</p>
            <p>Now if our <hi>Socinians</hi> shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> doth not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this Text, when he disputes against the <hi>Arians;</hi> we answer, 'Tis very possible that St. <hi>Austin</hi> might have a <hi>corrupt</hi> Copy before him; or if not so, yet having suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved his Doctrine by other Texts, he might see no <hi>need</hi> of this: but however, tho' St. <hi>Austin</hi> use it not, yet his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> owns it, and blames those as Infidels who left it out. And surely St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> since he wrote a Book, <hi>De Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis,</hi> was well acquainted with the Writings of that and former Ages.</p>
            <p>But if St. <hi>Hierom</hi> alone be not of gravity enough to be put in the Scales with, and to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance that great Man St. <hi>Austin,</hi> to help to make up weight we shall add to him the Testimony
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:205033:55"/>of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who writes thus,
<note place="margin">Cypr. de Unit. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. p. 181.</note>
               <hi>Scriptum est de Patre, &amp; filio, &amp; Spiritu Sancto: Et hi tres unum sunt:</hi> It is written of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: <hi>And these Three are One.</hi> But where is it so written? certainly in this dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Text, or no where. Now to make over-weight, and turn the Scales, we shall put in some Ounces more, I mean the Testimony of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that very early Author, whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> styles <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<note place="margin">Euseb. Hist Eccles. l 2. cap. 2.</note> a famous Man; and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers the most celebrated;
<note place="margin">Tert. adv. Praxeam, c. 25. p. 515</note> this <hi>Tertullian</hi> having mentioned the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately subjoyns, <hi>Qui tres unum sunt,</hi> which <hi>Three</hi> are <hi>One;</hi> and he thus expounds it, <hi>non unus,</hi> They are not <hi>One Person;</hi> but <hi>Ʋnum,</hi> One <hi>Thing:</hi> The Word, saith he, referring, <hi>Ad substantiae unitatem, non ad numeri singularita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> To the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> not to the <hi>Singularity</hi> of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:205033:56"/>
               <hi>number.</hi> And from these instances 'tis evident, that although St. <hi>Austin</hi> doth no where mention this disputed Text. Yet St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who lived in the same Age; and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived long before St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time, do; which sheweth, that in those early Days it was took for a part of the <hi>Canon;</hi> and if so, why should it not be thought so still?</p>
            <p>But further yet, if as to some <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, our <hi>Socinians</hi> shall object, That <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> who expounds this Epistle of St. <hi>John,</hi> takes no notice of this disputed Verse; we thus reply; namely, That <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Athan. Cont. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Disp. p. 147.</note> who was at least as great a <hi>Divine,</hi> and certainly of greater <hi>Antiquity,</hi> not only hath it, but useth it as a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Argument</hi> in his Disputation against <hi>Arius;</hi> for thus he tells him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>And these Three are One;</hi> he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name the <hi>Words,</hi> but their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:205033:56"/>
               <hi>Writer</hi> too, and peremptorily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes them to St. <hi>John.</hi> And had they not then been general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received as St. <hi>John</hi>'s indeed, we cannot imagine but <hi>Arius</hi> then, as our <hi>Socinians</hi> now do, would have denied the <hi>Authority</hi> of that Text which made so much against him, had it been in those Days thought liable to the suspicion of being supposititious.</p>
            <p>And since this Text in those early Days was received by the most eminent Divines of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church as an undoubted part of the <hi>Canon;</hi> and by them urged against those <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who denied the Doctrine therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; we have the same reason to own it as <hi>Canonical</hi> still; for the omission of it in some Copies, which comparatively are but few, and those few far more liable to suspicion than the Text it self, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not justly derogate any thing from its Authority: And the rather, because,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:205033:57"/> 3. We answer, that if this Text be left out, and the next Verse be admitted, as it is in <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> the Connexion of the Apostle's Discourse will not be so genuine, so coherent, and consonant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this disputed Text as with it.</p>
            <p>The next Verse runs thus; <hi>There are Three that bear witness in Earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, and these Three agree in One.</hi> Now in the foregoing Verse there is a fit <hi>Antithesis</hi> to every Clause in this, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> the Three Witnesses in the former Verse stand contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguished to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>Blood,</hi> the Three Witnesses in this. Again, those Words, <hi>in Heaven,</hi> in the former Verse, stand contradistinguished to the Words, <hi>in Earth,</hi> in this; and yet once more those Words, <hi>These Three are One,</hi> in the former Verse, stand in opposition to this Clause, <hi>These Three agree in One,</hi> in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Verse. Now if the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:205033:57"/>Verse were wholy omitted, the following Verse for want of a fit <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> answerable to every Member of it, would seem some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what uncouth: For to what end should the Apostle tell us of <hi>Three Witnesses in Earth,</hi> had he not, by way of distinction, already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>Three Witnesses in Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin,</hi> who well knew that this disputed Text was not found in several Copies both Greek and Latin, did yet think fit to receive and interpret it, as a part of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Epistle; and he hath left us Two Reasons why he did so, and they are both considerable: His first Reason is this, <hi>Quia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textus optimè fluit, si membrum hoc addatur,</hi> because the Context runs best if this part be added to it. His second Reason is this, <hi>Video in optimis &amp; probatissimae fidei codici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus haberi;</hi> because, saith he, I see that this Verse is found in the best and most approved Copies. by which it appears, that it was
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:205033:58"/>the Opinion of this Judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, That this Text, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Series of the Apostles Discourse the more agreeable to its self in its several parts, being found in Copies of the greatest Credit, should not be cashiered, barely because in some Copies it is left out: So he. But to say no more of this.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We answer, That the Reason of that difference, which is found betwixt several Copies, some <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> this Text, and some others <hi>wanting</hi> it, must arise either from <hi>carelesness,</hi> or from <hi>design,</hi> or <hi>Forgery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis very possible that this Text might be omitted through the meer <hi>Carelesness</hi> of some Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriber, whose too much hast might betray him, or whose Eye being oft took off from his Copy, might deceive him. And if this were the Case, we cannot wonder that this first mistake should grow and multiply: For if we grant, that any one Copy was made <hi>defective</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:205033:58"/>merely through the supine <hi>negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> and inadvertency of the Scribe; it must of necessity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all other Copies, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully transcribed, and derived suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively from that, must be guilty of the same defect; and what number of such Copies there may be in the World, who can tell? And if this little part of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Epistle were indeed omitted merely for want of more <hi>Care</hi> and better Intention either of the <hi>Mind</hi> or the <hi>Eye</hi> of some Transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whose Pen this Passage esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; shall the same Passage, being found in other Copies more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully transcribed, be counted the less <hi>Authentick?</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it will not be allowed, that the first omission of this Text was occasioned by the over-sight of some careless <hi>Scribe;</hi> then it must needs follow, That if this Text be <hi>Canonical,</hi> it must be first left out by some <hi>fraudulent Design;</hi> or if it be not <hi>Canonical,</hi> it must at first
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:205033:59"/>be put in by down-right <hi>Forgery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed such a <hi>fraudulent Design</hi> is on the one hand imputed to those Persons, who in former Ages denied the <hi>Trinity;</hi> and on the other hand, such a down-right <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery</hi> is imputed to those Persons who in former times did <hi>own</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and did vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously defend it. Now the question is, whether this imputation of <hi>Fraud</hi> to some, or of <hi>Forgery</hi> to others, do carry the fairer shew of Reason, and consequently the greater probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in it? Methinks this Question may be easily resolved, and the Resolution of it by all impartial and unprejudiced Persons may be as easily believed. For that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of those times, who <hi>professed</hi> and maintained the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> should <hi>forge</hi> this Text, is a Pretence that hath nothing of <hi>Probability</hi> in it: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Had the learned Men of those times <hi>forged</hi> this Text, and inserted it into several Copies, they might
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:205033:59"/>well have imagined, that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies</hi> of their Profession, who were <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Inquisitive</hi> Men, would quickly have <hi>detected</hi> such a Forgery, as did so much tend to their disadvantage; and being once detected, they would have objected it to their eternal shame; a thing which in those Days, so far as I yet know, no Man ever did.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The learned Men of those times had not the least <hi>Temptation</hi> to <hi>forge</hi> this Text; for had they done it, they must have done it to this end only: namely, to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> that Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which they asserted: But that Doctrine being already and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently established by a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of other Scriptures, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable Arguments deduced from them, they had no need to <hi>coin</hi> and counterfeit a new Text to help support it. And is it i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable, that Men of eminent Piety, who owned the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to be God, and as such <hi>adored</hi> him,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:205033:60"/>would make bold to <hi>counterfeit</hi> his Hand, and lay the <hi>Brats</hi> of their own Brains at his Door? Is it ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, that Men who knew the <hi>danger</hi> of adding any thing to the Word of God, should add a Text of their <hi>own</hi> Invention to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Canon,</hi> and impose it upon the Catholick Church, as if it had Been the immediate Dictate of the <hi>Holy Ghost?</hi> We cannot think it consistent with the known Piety of the ancient Fathers, that they should ever coin a <hi>Counterfeit</hi> Text, and then obtrude it upon the World, and make it pass, as if it bore the <hi>Spirit</hi>'s <hi>Stamp.</hi> Certainly, 'tis no way credible that such Men should, upon any <hi>pinch,</hi> commit such horrid Villainy; but much less <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> without any <hi>need,</hi> without so much as a <hi>Temptation</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>Now, since the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who <hi>owned</hi> the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> cannot with any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and fairly be charged with the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>Forgery,</hi> as if they of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:205033:60"/>their own motion had surreptiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously inserted <hi>this Text</hi> into the Sacred <hi>Canon:</hi> Some other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, more liable to just suspicion, must of necessity be charged with <hi>fraudulent</hi> and ill-dealing in leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out. This fraudulent deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing St. <hi>Hierom</hi> imputes, <hi>Infidelibus Translatoribus,</hi> by whom he means, as Authors judge, those <hi>Arian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> who had then crept into the <hi>Latin Church:</hi> and in their <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Translations had left out this Verse, which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> himself then found in the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies.</p>
            <p>And indeed tho' those ancient Fathers, who <hi>asserted</hi> the <hi>Trinity,</hi> had no need to <hi>forge,</hi> and add this Text to the <hi>Canon;</hi> yet they who <hi>denied</hi> the <hi>Trinity,</hi> had a very <hi>strong Temptation</hi> to <hi>leave</hi> it out. For this Text is, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> styles it, <hi>Telum, quo maximè confici po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terunt Ariani:</hi> And again, <hi>efficax telum adversus Arianos,</hi> An effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Argument against the <hi>Arians;</hi> and doubtless so it is against the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:205033:61"/>
               <hi>Arians</hi> and the <hi>Sabellians</hi> too. And, upon that score, <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> as cited by <hi>Estius,</hi> having mentioned this Text, subjoyns these Words, <hi>Audiat Sabellius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fulg. in libro de Trinitate.</note>
               <hi>sunt, ut audi, tres, &amp; credat esse tres personas:</hi> And then again. <hi>Audiat &amp; Arius Ʋnum; &amp; non dicat filium diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentis esse naturae;</hi> Let <hi>Sabellius</hi> hear, that there are <hi>Three that bear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Heaven;</hi> and let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are <hi>Three Persons;</hi> let <hi>Arius</hi> also hear, That <hi>These Three are One,</hi> and let him no more say,
<note place="margin">Fulg. in lib. Repons. ad decem Ob. Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum.</note> That the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> differs from that of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> For, as the same Author saith elsewhere, when St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>These Three are One, Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem substantiae accipimus;</hi> We take it, that the Apostle means the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of <hi>Substance,</hi> such a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical <hi>Ʋnity</hi> as is peculiar to these Three Glorious Persons: For as a learned Interpreter well observes,
<note place="margin">Jac. Capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> had the Apostle meant no greater Unity than that of <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Consent,</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:205033:61"/>he had said no more of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity, than may be truly said of all the Inhabitants of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for in respect of such an Unity all glorified <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to conclude this Matter; this Text being generally received as a part of the <hi>Canon,</hi> and being expounded as it is, by pious, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and judicious Men, both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, and later Divines, according to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, and the manifest Sense of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures; the Doctrine of the blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> stands built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as a firm <hi>Basis,</hi> and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable <hi>Rock:</hi> And methinks in the Judgment of all Men, who are not <hi>wedded</hi> to <hi>Heterodox</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but are willing to <hi>submit</hi> to <hi>Truth,</hi> the contrary Doctrines of <hi>Ebion, Sabellius, Photinus, Arius, Socinus,</hi> and other Hereticks, like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the <hi>Ark,</hi> should fall to the Ground: And indeed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry modest Man's Understanding
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:205033:62"/>should stoop and yield up it self to this Divine Revelation, though it contain such a Doctrine, as doth exceed the Comprehension of Humane Reason.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My third and last Work is this; namely, to prove the <hi>Deity</hi> of those Persons in the Trinity, which hath been, and still is, so much disputed.</p>
            <p>As for that <hi>glorious Being,</hi> whom we call the <hi>First,</hi> and Hereticks have thought the <hi>only</hi> Person in the Godhead, there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, unless it be with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Atheists,</hi> who, like other <hi>Monsters,</hi> the Miscarriages of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are but <hi>few,</hi> and those few condemned by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all Nations. The dispute of old betwixt the <hi>Fathers</hi> and the <hi>Arians,</hi> and the present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute betwixt <hi>us</hi> and our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Socinians,</hi> doth concern the Deity of the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third</hi> Persons, each of whom we esteem
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:205033:62"/>and religiously adore as God, equal with the Father.</p>
            <p>To prove the Deity of both these Persons, I shall use Two sorts of Texts: First, such Texts as do plainly and most expresly ascribe to both these Persons the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> of God. 2. Such Texts as do ascribe to both these Persons such <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> as are peculiar to God alone. I begin with the Second Person, whom we commonly call <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Son.</hi> And.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are several Texts, which do in the most plain and express Terms ascribe to this blessed Person, the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Evangelical Prophet styles him, the <hi>Mighty God;</hi> and which is much the same thing,
<note place="margin">Esa. 9.6.</note> the <hi>Everlasting Father.</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who knew him well, who saw his stupendious Miracles, who heard his incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Discourses, and was thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with his holy Life
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:205033:63"/>and Conversation,
<note place="margin">Joh. 20.28.</note> calls him, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was an inspired Apostle, and knew well enough what he said or wrote, styles him,
<note place="margin">Rom. 9.5.</note>

               <hi>The Glorious appearance of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ?</hi> That both these Titles, the <hi>Great God</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> do equally belong to our Lord, and were by the Apostle intended for him, we have the opinion of considerable Persons; and for their being of that judgment they are commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too.

            </p>
            <p>The same Interpretation of these words is given by <hi>Drusius,</hi> who saith, <hi>Non solùm Deus, sed etiam Deus Magnus vocatur hic Christus:</hi> Christ is here called, not only <hi>God,</hi> but the <hi>Great God.</hi> And so <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius à Lapide, Filium hic utrobique intelligi patet:</hi> It is manifest, saith he, that by both these Titles, the

               <hi>Great God</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> is understood. And indeed there is very good reason for it.</p>
            <p>For the Text mentions, <hi>The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Appearance of the Great God and Saviour;</hi> which without all controversie, relates to the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment;</hi> wherein, not God the <hi>Father,</hi> but the <hi>Son,</hi> shall visibly and gloriously appear, and sit as Judge.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Saviour,</hi> is an intimation, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth here mean but <hi>one</hi> single Person: For, if by the <hi>Great God,</hi> he had meant the <hi>Father,</hi> as by the <hi>Saviour,</hi> he must mean the <hi>Son;</hi> he would, in all probability, have used the Article <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as a Note of <hi>Distinction</hi> between them; that being the known and common use of that Article in other Authors.</p>
            <p>Now then, if from the force and Phrase of the Text, and the Authority of these and other judicious Interpreters, we may conclude, that our blessed Saviour
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:205033:65"/>is indeed the Person here called the <hi>Great God;</hi> this glorious Title must needs distinguish him from, and advance him far above, all those Persons, who, by vertue of some <hi>great Office,</hi> are <hi>Nominal</hi> and <hi>Titular Gods,</hi> and no more.</p>
            <p>That any <hi>Prince,</hi> by vertue of his <hi>Office,</hi> was ever styled, the <hi>Great God,</hi> is more than I do yet know; I read, that some notorious <hi>Sycophants</hi> have styled the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome, Pontifex Maximus,</hi> the <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> of <hi>Priests.</hi> Nay more, <hi>Dominus Deus noster Papa;</hi> Our <hi>Lord God</hi> the Pope; but not <hi>Magnus Deus,</hi> our <hi>Great</hi> God the Pope.

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Erasmus,</hi> who is observed to be too kind to the <hi>Arians,</hi> tells us, that some Men of their Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being induced, as may be well supposed, by this Text; <hi>Christum Magnum Deum fatentur, sed verum negant,</hi> do confess, that <hi>Christ</hi> is a <hi>Great God,</hi> but deny that he is a <hi>True</hi> one. 'Tis very strange that Men should be of such an opinion, considering what St. <hi>John</hi> saith of our Lord, <hi>This is the True God:</hi> But doth he mean the <hi>Father</hi> or the <hi>Son?</hi> Of that we may judge by his words immediately forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For, having said, <hi>We are in him, that is true, even in his Son
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:205033:66"/>Jesus Christ,</hi> he subjoyns these words, not a syllable intervening; <hi>This is the True God:</hi> i. e. in common construction, <hi>This Jesus Christ,</hi> the Person last mentioned.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Rule in <hi>Grammar,</hi> That when there are <hi>two Antecedents,</hi> the <hi>Relative Hic, This,</hi> doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally relate, <hi>ad Posterius &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> to that Antecedent, which is the <hi>latter</hi> and the <hi>nearer</hi> to it. Suppose we then that there be two Antecedents here in the Context; God the <hi>Father,</hi> one; and <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the other; the first being at a distance from the Relative, and the second being contiguous to it, the Relative must, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rule of <hi>Grammar,</hi> and Propriety of Speech, refer to the latter; and then the Apostle's meaning is, Jesus Christ is the True God.</p>
            <p>And this Interpretation of the Text is much confirmed by the words that follow;
<note place="margin">Joh. 10.28.</note>
               <hi>This is the True God, and Life Eternal,</hi> i. the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:205033:66"/>Author and giver of Life Eternal; and who is that, our Lord answers, <hi>I give unto them Eternal Life:</hi> And again, <hi>I am the Life:</hi> And so St. <hi>John, He that hath the Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 11.25.</note>
               <hi>hath Life:</hi> And to the same purpose run many other Texts. Now, since St. <hi>John</hi> expresly saith of <hi>One</hi> and the same Person,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.12.</note>
               <hi>This is the True God:</hi> And, <hi>This is the Life Eternal.</hi> And since by, <hi>This Life Eternal,</hi> he must needs, according to many other Scriptures, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> who is the Fountain of Life; we have all reason to believe, that, when he saith, <hi>This is the True God,</hi> he means him too.</p>
            <p>But because, notwithstanding these Evidences, our <hi>Socinians</hi> may raise some Cavils against this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and endeavour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out just reason, to divert these Scriptures to another sense; to prove that our Lord is more than a <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Office,</hi> to these Texts I shall add two Arguments,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:205033:67"/> 1. My first Argument is this: That blessed Person, who was a God <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Creation,</hi> is more than a <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Office.</hi> But our Saviour is that blessed Person, who was a God before the Creation.</p>
            <p>The Major Proposition may be thus explained: Gods by <hi>Office</hi> are so termed only in respect of that <hi>Authority</hi> and Government, which God Almighty hath by his Providence committed to them. But before the Creation there was no occasion for, no use of any such delegated Power; there were none such to govern, there were none to be governed; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there could then be no God by Office.</p>
            <p>But our blessed Saviour was a God even then; for, St. <hi>John</hi> saith of him, <hi>the word was God:</hi> But when was he so? the Text answers; <hi>In the beginning:</hi> which must needs import some space at least before the Creation, because it follows,
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.3.</note>
               <hi>All things were made by
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:205033:67"/>him;</hi> which must of necessity sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his own <hi>Praeexistence;</hi> and if our Lord were a God, when there could be no <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Office;</hi> he must be God under another Notion, even by <hi>Nature,</hi> and from all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My Second Argument shall be this, That blessed Person, who <hi>now</hi> is, and <hi>will</hi> be a God, when the World shall be at an end, is more than a God by Office. But our blessed Saviour is, and will be such a God.</p>
            <p>To such as are <hi>Gods</hi> by <hi>Office,</hi> and no more, God Almighty speaks thus by the Psalmist,
<note place="margin">Ps. 81.6.</note>
               <hi>I have said ye are Gods, but ye shall die like Men.</hi> And when once they die, their Authority ceaseth, their Breath and their Authority, and with it their <hi>Godship,</hi> expire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>But 'tis not thus with our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour; for tho' the Offices of his Mediatorship shall one day cease; yet his Power, Authority,
<note place="margin">Isa. 9.7.</note>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:205033:68"/>and Government shall last for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; when he shall be no longer King of Nations, he shall still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main King of Saints. For the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Prophet hath given us this Assurance, <hi>Of his Government there shall be no end.</hi> And to him God the Father hath said,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.8.</note>
               <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever:</hi> And him doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> style, <hi>God blessed for ever.</hi> And are these the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of <hi>Gods</hi> by <hi>Office?</hi> Doth their Government last for ever? And are they Gods sitting upon a Throne to Eternity? Are they Gods Blessed without an end? 'Tis well for <hi>Gods</hi> by <hi>Office,</hi> if when they die, and their <hi>Godship</hi> ceaseth, they prove so much as <hi>Saints,</hi> and Companions fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with <hi>Angels.</hi> 'Tis our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, who is such a God as justly deserves that Character which <hi>Homer</hi> bestows upon those falsly supposed Deities, whom he styles, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 'Tis our Lord who was from Eternity, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:205033:68"/>whose Person and Deity shall exist for ever. To him we may say, as the Psalmist doth, <hi>From everlasting to everlasting thou art God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these Texts that I have named, and these Arguments which I have urged, I think, are such as our <hi>Socinians</hi> can never fairly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; I conceive them sufficient to confute the pretence of those Men, who, because they cannot deny that our blessed Saviour is once and again styled a God, that they may with some little colour rob him of his Essential Divinity, do give it out, That he is a <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Office,</hi> as many other Men have been, and no more. But to go on.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are several Texts which ascribe to our blessed Saviour such <hi>Attributes</hi> and such <hi>Works,</hi> as do plainly prove him <hi>God,</hi> and that in the strictest and most proper Sense of that Notion, as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a Being Omnipotent, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:205033:69"/>Omnipresent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From which Attributes, and the Effects of them, we may raise Arguments enough, and very sufficient, to prove him the <hi>true God.</hi> As for instance;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That blessed Person, who is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> who can by his own Almighty Power do whatever he will, whatever can be done, is the true God. But such an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Person is our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>The utmost Power of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> is so <hi>restrained</hi> and limited, that they cannot do whatever may be done, at least by any strength which is their own. But now 'tis otherwise with God, that God who thus demands, <hi>Is there any thing too hard for me?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 32.27.</note> To this Question we may answer in the Words of <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 42.2.</note>
               <hi>I know that thou canst do every thing:</hi> So saith our Lord,
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.26.</note>
               <hi>With God all things are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi> Whatsoever is not <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> to <hi>Truth,</hi> whatsoever is not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:205033:69"/>
               <hi>repugnant</hi> to his own <hi>Perfections,</hi> whatever he can <hi>Will,</hi> he can also do, and he alone.</p>
            <p>The Devil indeed can play Tricks, and work lying Wonders, as he did by the Magicians in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> but real Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles he cannot do. Their Demand was reasonable, who put this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<note place="margin">Joh. 10.21.</note>
               <hi>Can a Devil open the Eyes of the blind?</hi> 'Tis sure he cannot. We also read, that <hi>Moses,</hi> and some of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and our Lord's <hi>Apostles</hi> did several real Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; but yet they could not work them, <hi>when, where</hi> and as <hi>oft</hi> as they pleased. So complained the Father of a Lunatick Son, <hi>I brought him to thy Disciples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 17.16</note>
               <hi>and they could not cure him.</hi> Doubtless they did attempt a Cure, but in vain. And the Reason must be this; The Power, whereby they wrought other Miracles, was not their own, and the efficacious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it was lent them upon a Condition, wherein at that time they failed.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:205033:70"/>
            <p> But that our blessed Saviour was and is a Person of Omnipotent Power, able at all times, and in all Cases, to do whatsoever his Pleasure was, is, or shall be, may be proved by these Four Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Omnipotent Power of Christ may be proved by the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> which he wrought in his own Person whilst he conversed in this lower World.</p>
            <p>What his Miracles were the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist tells us, <hi>The blind receive their sight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11.5.</note>
               <hi>and the lame Walk, the Lepers are cleansed, and the Deaf hear, the dead are raised up.</hi> The truth of his Miracles was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by his most bitter Enemies: The <hi>Pharisees</hi> themselves who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted his Person to the Death, did thus confess, <hi>This Man doth many Miracles.</hi> And as his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were <hi>more</hi> in number, so were they <hi>greater</hi> in their Nature, and in their Circumstances, than had ever been wrought amongst
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:205033:70"/>them; for why else did the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Multitude cry out,
<note place="margin">Mat. 9.33.</note>
               <hi>It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so seen in Israel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That his raising the dead only by his Word; that his cleansing a Leper only by his Will; that his curing a Centurion's Servant, and a Nobleman's Son at a distance, no natural means being used; that when he had fed Five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Persons with Five Loaves, and Two Fishes, the Fragments that were left, should be a greater Quantity than the whole Bread at first; that his curing a blind Man with a Cataplasm of Spittle and Clay, a thing more likely to <hi>put</hi> out <hi>seeing Eyes</hi> than to <hi>enlighten blind</hi> ones, I say, that these and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miracles of his should ever be wrought by the proper Power or Art of any <hi>mere</hi> Man, Is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impossible. And so <hi>Nicodemus</hi> rightly judged, when he spake thus to our Lord,
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.2.</note>
               <hi>No Man can do these Miracles which thou dost, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God be with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="122" facs="tcp:205033:71"/>
            <p> And that God was with him indeed, is evident from several Expressions. That of our Lord is one;
<note place="margin">Joh. 8.29.</note>
               <hi>The Father hath not left me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that in working Miracles,
<note place="margin">Act. 10.38.</note>
               <hi>God was with him;</hi> and not only <hi>with him,</hi> but <hi>in him</hi> too: So saith the same Apostle,
<note place="margin">Col. 2.9.</note>
               <hi>In him dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the God head bodily, i.</hi> saith a learned Interpreter of our own Church,
<note place="margin">Davenant. in Col. 2.9.</note>
               <hi>per unionem Hypostaticam,</hi> by a Personal Union; an Union so close, that our Lord saith else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>The Father is in me, and I in him;</hi> and by reason of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation, which, I think, the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers mean by their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<note place="margin">Joh. 10.38, 39.</note> our Saviour saith, <hi>I and my Father are One:</hi> How One? One in <hi>Essence,</hi> and consequently One, as in all other Perfections, so in point of <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They indeed, who unjustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Hypostatical Union of the Divine and Humane Natures in the Person of Christ, may by a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:205033:71"/>just Consequence, were their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion true, affirm that our Lord wrought all his Miracles, not by his own Power; but, as other Men did, by a Power that was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lent him.

               </gap>, saith <hi>Theophylact;</hi> seemed to them to be, and indeed was, more than a Man. For, as our Lord saith,
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.8.</note>
               <hi>The Wind bloweth where it listeth;</hi> 'Tis not in the Power of Man to prevent it; no, to have a command over Wind and Water is God's Prerogative; and as such doth the Psalmist men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it:
<note place="margin">Ps. 107.29.</note>
               <hi>He makes the Storm a Calm.</hi> 'Tis mentioned as an Argument of God's Omnipotence:
<note place="margin">Ps. 89.8.</note>
               <hi>O Lord God of Hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee?</hi> And the very first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God's infinite Power there given is this, <hi>Thou rulest the raging of the Sea; and when the Waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</hi> 'Tis an Act of Divine Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:205033:72"/>and since our Saviour did it, 'tis an Evidence of his own Almighty power, and such a Power must needs prove him God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That our blessed Saviour was a Person, who had an Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Power of his own, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from those miraculous Works which were done by his Apostles, both before his Death, and after his Ascension.</p>
            <p>During the time of our Lord's conversing in the World, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Persons, who wanted help in any kind, making their Applications to his own Person, we do not find many Instances of miraculous Works done by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, whilst he himself was with them; only when he had sent them abroad, the Evangelist tells us, That when they were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<note place="margin">Luk. 9.10.</note>
               <hi>They told him all that they had done;</hi> many Miracles no doubt, though they are not particularly recorded. The Seventy Disciples
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:205033:73"/>mention but one,
<note place="margin">Luk. 10.17</note> namely this, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Devils are subject to us.</hi> Doubtless the Devil, who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Prince of this World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14.30.</note> and is a very powerful Spirit, is so loath to quit his Possessions, that nothing less than Omnipotence can eject and turn him out.</p>
            <p>But when once our Lord had left the World, and no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Addresses could be made to him as a visible and present Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; they who wanted extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary help in several Cases, betook themselves to his Apostles, and found that relief from them, which they could not find elsewhere. St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Act. 2.43.</note>
               <hi>Many Wonders and Signs were done by the Apostles:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he mentions <hi>special Miracles wrought by the hands of Paul:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 19.11.</note> They healed the Sick, cured the Lame, and raised the dead; such migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Works they did, that they were took for <hi>Gods</hi> in the shape of Men.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:205033:73"/>
            <p> Nor indeed can we much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it should be so; that those Persons should mistake our Lord's Apostles for <hi>Gods,</hi> who saw them do such Works as were far above the Power of <hi>Men.</hi> The Spectators of those Miracles saw the Instruments who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about them, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no farther, the Hand that did them being invisible. And whose Hand that was, St. <hi>Luke</hi> informs us; <hi>God wrought special Miracles by the Hands of Paul. Paul</hi> was but a Tool, the Workman was God; and not the <hi>Father</hi> only, but the <hi>Son</hi> too; for to him did St. <hi>Peter</hi> aferibe the miraculous Cure of a Man who had been lame from his Infancy, <hi>His Name,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3.16.</note>
               <hi>(the Name of Christ) hath made this man strong,</hi> &amp;c. And that the Apostles did indeed work their Miracles by our Lord's Authority, is yet more evident from the Cure of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who had kept his Bed eight years, of which we have this Account;
<note place="margin">Act. 9.34.</note>
               <hi>Peter said
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:205033:74"/>unto him, Aeneas, arise, and make thy Bed: And he arose immediately.</hi> Here was an easie, and a very quick Cure indeed; but by whom was it wrought? not by <hi>Peter</hi> himself, who told his Patient thus, <hi>Jesus Christ maketh thee whole.</hi> That Power whereby the Apostles wrought their Miracles, their Lord, whose presence went along with them, was pleased to exert, when any just occasion did so require. Accordingly the Evangelist tells us, That when he sent them first abroad,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.1.</note>
               <hi>He gave them power over unclean Spirits to cast them out, and to heal all manner of Sickness,</hi> &amp;c. And certainly, our Lord gave them nothing but that which was his <hi>own;</hi> since he communicated such a Power to his Servants, as ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them to be instrumental in working so many mighty Miracles, we must conclude, That he had such a Power, and in a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er measure, <hi>Originally</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; even such an Omnipotent
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:205033:74"/>Power, as still proves him God. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That our blessed Saviour is a Person, who had and still hath an Omnipotent Power, may be strongly proved by the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from the dead; I mean other Men's and his own too.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our blessed Saviour is a Person, who had and still hath an Omnipotent Power, may be strongly proved by the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other Men from the dead.</p>
            <p>There are not many Articles of our Creed, which seem more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to Humane Reason, which have been more impugned, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and denied by Jews and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, than that, which concerns the Resurrection of the dead. It hath been thought by some to be <hi>needless,</hi> by others to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient;</hi> and, which is to my present purpose, by many it hath been judged <hi>impossible.</hi> Such an intimation we have from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who thus argued this Matter with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:205033:75"/>King <hi>Agrippa;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 26.8.</note>
               <hi>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</hi> Hence 'tis evident, that they were of the same opinion with <hi>Celsus</hi> in <hi>Origen,</hi> who said of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that 'tis a Work, which God, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, neither will do, nor can.</p>
            <p>And indeed the great difficulty of this Work is evident from that demand of God to his Prophet; <hi>Son of Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 37.3.</note>
               <hi>can these dry Bones live?</hi> Is it possible to revive them? certainly not to Men or Angels; and, for that reason, they who told the Ruler of the Synagogue, <hi>Thy Daughter is dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 5.35.</note> added this withal, <hi>why troublest thou the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster any further?</hi> It was their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Christ himself in such a case could do no good. Nor had these Men been at all mistaken, had not our Lord been a far greater Person, than the Jews did then suppose him to be; had he had no more Power, than could
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:205033:75"/>belong to the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> as merely such; to a dead Person his presence, and his very best assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would have proved but vain.</p>
            <p>But we are well assured that our Lord did revive, not only this dead Woman, but several dead Men too; and hath engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he will one day raise all the rest. For thus he hath told us,
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.25.</note>
               <hi>The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear, shall live:</hi> And again,
<note place="margin">Joh. 6.40.</note>
               <hi>I will raise him up at the last day.</hi> 'Tis men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as an Act of his <hi>own</hi> Power; why else did he say,
<note place="margin">Joh. 11.25.</note>
               <hi>I am the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and the Life?</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt, but he, who spake these Words, and made these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, knew his <hi>own</hi> Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them; and that Power must be Omnipotent, and this Act of that Omnipotence doth again prove him to be no less than God. It's true, his Apostles raised the dead, and yet were not Gods: But here's
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:205033:76"/>the difference, they did it by <hi>his</hi> Power, but he by <hi>his</hi> own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That our blessed Saviour was, and still is, a Person of an Almighty Power, may be strongly proved by his own Resurrection form the Grave.</p>
            <p>That our Lord did indeed arise from the Grave is an undoubted Article of our Creed; 'tis confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the united Testimonies of good Men and glorious Angels; 'tis proved by such undeniable Arguments, as cannot fail us. The <hi>Truth</hi> of our Lord's Resurrection being granted, all the Question is touching the <hi>Authour</hi> of it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were <hi>himself,</hi> or some <hi>other</hi> Person. It may be demanded, whether a Man truly dead, as our Lord was, be in any capacity to revive himself, to come out of his Grave, and live a second life: 'Tis that, which no mere Man ever did or can do; and yet our Lord did it.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:205033:76"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> indeed tells us, That <hi>Cleomedes</hi> and <hi>Alcmena</hi> being dead, revived. <hi>Plato</hi> writes, That one <hi>Er,</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> Soldier, being slain in a Battel, lay dead in the Field ten days together, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards being carried home to be buried, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the 12th day he revived and lived again. And <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports,
<note place="margin">Herodotus in Melpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene. p. 230.</note> That one <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staeus,</hi> being dead and prepared for Burial, his Body vanished, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seven Years was found <hi>alive</hi> in <hi>Proconnesus.</hi> Were any of these Stories true, these Persons must be revived by some <hi>other</hi> Power, whereas our Lord arose by <hi>his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, our Lord is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times said in a <hi>Passive</hi> sense, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be Raised; and sometimes in an <hi>Active</hi> sense, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to <hi>rise</hi> again. But this variety of Expression doth not alter the Nature of the thing, nor weaken the Argument which I am drawing from it; for, our Lord's Resurrection in either sense,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:205033:77"/>is an undeniable proof of his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence. When he is said <hi>Active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to <hi>rise,</hi> 'tis meant, that so he did by his <hi>own</hi> Power; and when he is said <hi>Passively</hi> to <hi>be</hi> raised, 'tis meant, that his <hi>Humane</hi> Nature was raised by his <hi>Divine,</hi> that the <hi>God</hi> raised the <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this, <hi>gratis dictum;</hi> 'Tis not said without a sufficient ground: For, that our Lord did not want a Power able enough to raise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the Grave, is evident from that expression of his,
<note place="margin">Joh. 10.18.</note>
               <hi>I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again.</hi> Certainly, by the taking of his life again, he can mean nothing else but his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead: For, as <hi>Drusius</hi> saith, <hi>Animam ponit, qui moritur; assumit, qui resurgit:</hi> He layeth down his life, who dieth; and he resumes his life, who riseth again: and so to do, our Lord doth here claim a sufficient Power. And surely, since our Lord did use this power to raise <hi>other</hi> dead Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:205033:77"/>he would much more use it to raise <hi>himself;</hi> especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering to what a glorious estate his Resurrection would and did advance him.</p>
            <p>This Power of his to take his life again at his pleasure, is very highly and very justly magnified by the Fathers: St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a thing very <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>wonderful: Theophylact</hi> saith, That it proves our Lord to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord and Commander both of Death and Life: And St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> speaks of it thus;

               </gap>: To have a power to reassume a departed Soul, is by no means the property of Men, but it belongs to, and is an evidence of the power of the Word, <hi>i.</hi> of Christ. That blessed Lord of ours, whom St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:205033:78"/>thus bespeaks:
<note place="margin">Cypria. de passione Christi. p. 337. Edit. Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuis.</note>
               <hi>Tu, Domine, qui Potestativè ponis animam, &amp; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testativè resumis.</hi> An expression, which sheweth that our Lord had as much power to <hi>resume</hi> his life, as he had to <hi>lay</hi> it down; it was wholly at his own choice to die, and it was in his own power to raise and revive himself again, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when he pleased. And as his capacity to die shewed the <hi>Infirmity</hi> of his <hi>Humane</hi> Nature, so his <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to <hi>raise</hi> himself proved his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence,</hi> and that Act of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence did again prove him God. But yet once more:</p>
            <p n="4">4. That our blessed Saviour is a Person, who had and still hath an Almighty Power, may be yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and strongly proved by the works of Creation and Providence.</p>
            <p>Works of Creation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of Providence, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do every where ascribe to <hi>God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1.1.</note> so <hi>Moses, God created the Heaven and the Earth;</hi> And so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note>
               <hi>The Lord made Heaven and

               <note place="margin">Esa. 40.28.</note>
               <hi>and all that in them is.</hi> 'Tis he, whom the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prophet styles, <hi>The Everlasting God, the Lord, the Creatour of the Ends of the Earth.</hi> And indeed it must needs be so; for, since Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is, <hi>Productio Entis ex non Ente,</hi> the production of <hi>something</hi> out of <hi>nothing,</hi> there being a vast distance betwixt these two Terms, it must be the effect of an Infinite Power, and such power there is none, save only that of God.</p>
            <p>Now, that our blessed Saviour did create the World, we are told again and again: St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>All things were made by him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1.3.</note>
               <hi>and without him was nothing made, that was made.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.16.</note>
               <hi>By him were all things created, that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, visible and invisible.</hi> And again,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note>
               <hi>God by him made the Worlds:</hi> But how by him? Not by him, as a <hi>Man,</hi> for then he was not such: Not by him, as a <hi>Servant,</hi> not as an <hi>Instrument;</hi> for, our Lord saith,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:205033:79"/>
               <hi>My Father worketh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 5.17.</note>
               <hi>and I work.</hi> Here he speaks of himself, not as a <hi>Tool</hi> in his Father's hand, but as a <hi>Fellow-worker</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>But had not our Lord's Power been equal with his Father's, had he been no more than a Creature, he could have had no hand in the work of Creation. St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Aug. de Trin. l. 3. cap. 8. Tom. 3.</note>
               <hi>Nec malos, sed nec bonos An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos fas est putare Creatores:</hi> 'Tis not lawful to think that evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, no nor good ones, can be Creators.
<note place="margin">Bellarm. de effectu Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. l. 2. cap. 11. p. 156.</note> So thought <hi>Bellarmine, Nullam Creaturam posse Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliter concurrere ad Creationem.</hi> And before him <hi>Aquinas,</hi> who sets this down as a certain conclusion,
<note place="margin">Aquin. 1. par. qu. 45. Art. 5.</note>
               <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibile est, quòd alicui Creaturae conveniat creare, neque virtute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria, neque instrumentalitèr, sive per Ministerium: i.</hi> 'Tis impossible for any Creature to create any thing, either by its <hi>own</hi> Power, or as an <hi>Instrument</hi> in anothers hand. 'Tis the judgment of these and other learned Men, that a Creating
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:205033:79"/>Power, through the Incapacity of all Creatures to be the Subjects of it, is absolutely <hi>incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if so, since we are sure that our Lord had an equal Hand with his Father and his Holy Spirit in creating the Universe, we must conclude, That he hath an equal Power, and that Power being Omnipotent, he is and must be God. And that is my first Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove him so.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That blessed Person, who is <hi>Omniscient,</hi> is truly God: But our blessed Saviour is a Person that is Omniscient.</p>

               <hi>I the Lord search the Heart;</hi> so the Psalmist found it, <hi>O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me, thou understandest my Thought afar off,</hi> i. <hi>antequam sit,</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:205033:80"/>I think it. Such a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Knower of <hi>Hearts</hi> was our blessed Saviour; for St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>He knew what was in Man:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 2.25. Luk. 6.8.</note> And St. <hi>Luke</hi> saith, <hi>He knew their Thoughts.</hi> Nay, it seems very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from the Series of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical History, that our Lord <hi>foreknew</hi> the Inclinations and Thoughts of Men before the Men themselves were acquainted with them. St. <hi>John</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Joh. 6.64.</note>
               <hi>Jesus knew from the beginning who should betray him,</hi> even before <hi>Judas</hi> had any <hi>thought</hi> of it, or <hi>Temptation</hi> to it. And certainly St. <hi>Peter</hi> had no thought of denying his Lord, when he said, <hi>That he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die than deny him;</hi> and yet our Lord <hi>foresaw</hi> that he would sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it.</p>
            <p>Now the Question is, How came our Lord by this <hi>Prescience</hi> and Fore-knowledge of his? All the Knowledge of Man is either <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>acquired,</hi> or <hi>infused,</hi> and from Divine Revelation. If we
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:205033:81"/>consider our blessed Saviour as a meer Man; 'tis certain that all his natural or acquired Knowledge could never enable him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Thoughts, and foresee the Inclinations of Men; and if so, he must needs do this, as he was Man, by Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But if our Lord knew the Hearts and Thoughts of other Men by a Divine Revelation, it may be said, that such a Knowledge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove him God; for such a Knowledge hath been found in some other Persons, in Prophets and Apostles, who yet were no more than Men. When <hi>Elisha</hi> told <hi>Hazael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Reg. 8.12, 13.</note>
               <hi>I know the Evil that thou wilt do;</hi> he knew the Heart of <hi>Hazael</hi> better than himself; for he thus replyed,
<note place="margin">1 Chr. 12.10.</note>
               <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog, that he should do this great thing?</hi> And yet he did it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that there was in his time <hi>a gift of discerning Spirits, i.</hi> either of that inward <hi>Sincerity,</hi> or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:205033:81"/>secret <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> that lay hid in the Hearts of Men. Such a discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Spirits very probably was found in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ananias</hi> thus,
<note place="margin">Act. 5.3.</note>
               <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy Heart to lye to the Holy Ghost?</hi> And yet again, <hi>Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy Heart?</hi> Upon which Words <hi>Lori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> makes this Observation,
<note place="margin">Lorinus in locum.</note>
               <hi>Hic deprehenditur Petro communicata divinitùs occultarum rerum scientia;</hi> From hence we may perceive that God was pleased to communicate to St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Knowledge of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> things: For such was the Fraud and Hypocrisie of <hi>Ananias,</hi> which could not probably be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to St. <hi>Peter</hi> by any <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations</hi> from <hi>Men,</hi> but by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> from <hi>God.</hi> Now if we suppose and take this for a grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truth, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> knew the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and the dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that lurked therein, by an immediate <hi>Revelation</hi> from God; yet notwithstanding <hi>Peter</hi> himself
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:205033:82"/>still remained no more than a mere mortal <hi>Man.</hi> And if so, how can any such Knowledge, gained by <hi>Revelation,</hi> prove our Saviour to be a God? To which demand I thus reply:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Knowledge which our Saviour had of the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men, was a great deal <hi>larger,</hi> and much more <hi>extensive</hi> than that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which any <hi>Prophets</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> ever had. For whereas they understood the Hearts only of some very <hi>few</hi> particular Men, and that upon some <hi>extraordinary</hi> and emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occasion, worthy of a new Revelation; 'tis expresly said of our Lord,
<note place="margin">Joh. 2.24.</note>
               <hi>He knew all Men.</hi> Upon which Words <hi>Theophylact</hi> hath this Paraphrase, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Our Lord was not ignorant what were the Thoughts of <hi>every</hi> Mans Heart; and certainly such an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Knowledge speaks him more than a Man, for no mere Man ever had it, or can attain it.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:205033:82"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> was an inspired Person, and had abundance of Revelations, and yet he thus professeth,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.20</note>
               <hi>We know but in part.</hi> No; who it is that hath an Universal Knowledge St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>God is greater than our Hearts, and knoweth All things.</hi> This Omniscience is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to God alone; and if so, since it was found in our blessed Lord, who knew the Hearts of all Men, which no <hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>Apostle</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, he must be truly God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Knowledge which our Saviour had of the <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Thoughts</hi> of Men, differed from that of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> as in its <hi>Extension,</hi> so in respect of its <hi>Cause,</hi> Ground, and Principle; they received all this Knowledge by <hi>Revelation,</hi> and by that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which our Lord did not do; they had all their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Mens Hearts from <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but his he had of and from <hi>himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="146" facs="tcp:205033:83"/>
            <p> The discerning of Spirits by our Lord's Apostles, or some few other Apostolical Men is call'd a Gift, and whose Gift both that and some other were, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.11.</note>
               <hi>All these worketh that One and the same Spirit.</hi> It was by the secret Illuminations of the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and nothing else, that our Lord's Apostles were enabled to discern the Hearts of Men; but this was not our Lord's Case al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together.</p>
            <p>They who denied that our Lord had Two distinct Wills suitable to the Two distinct Natures that were united in his Sacred Person, were branded with the Name of <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelites,</hi> and condemned as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks by a Council at <hi>Rome</hi> gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the First in the Year 652, or, as some say, 650. And if it be Heresie to deny a distinction of <hi>Will</hi> in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Person, it must be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to allow a like distinction of <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> too. As he was
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:205033:83"/>God, his Understanding was <hi>Infinite:</hi> For, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> tells us, with God, <hi>Esse &amp; Intelligere idem sunt;</hi> His <hi>Essence</hi> and his <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> are one and the same thing; so that the One be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinite, the other must be so too.</p>
            <p>But our Lord's <hi>Humane</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was capable of several <hi>degrees</hi> and measures of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Accordingly the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list tells us,
<note place="margin">Luk. 2.52.</note>
               <hi>Jesus encreased in Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Stature.</hi> As his <hi>Body</hi> grew in <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Stature,</hi> so his <hi>Ʋnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> encreased in <hi>Knowledge.</hi> And we cannot doubt, but all that Knowledge, which might any way be useful to him in the dispatch of that great Work for which he came, was by his <hi>own Deity</hi> communicated to his <hi>Manhood.</hi> One part of his Work was to instruct the World by his Doctrine and Example; but the most considerable part of his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was to die. But lest he might
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:205033:84"/>have been surprized with Death before his time, and thereby some other parts of his Work might have been left undone; it was convenient for him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Hearts, Intentions, and Designs of his Enemies, who sought to kill him; and this he knew, considered as Man, by <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, by the way, the Reason why our Lord's <hi>Humane</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was kept in ignorance touching the Day and Hour of the last Judgment, might well be this; namely, because God Almighty did not see it <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,</hi> but rather <hi>prejudicial,</hi> that the World should be taught that Lesson; and, upon that Score, our Lord, who in his Humane Nature was the <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> had no need, as such, to know it.</p>
            <p>But, that our Lord knew the hearts of Men by another sort of Knowledge, besides that by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:205033:84"/>seems evident from that expression of the Evangelist,
<note place="margin">Joh. 6.61.</note>
               <hi>Jesus knew in himself;</hi> not by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Ear, not by any Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from other Men, no nor meerly by any Revelation from Heaven; but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>In and by himself. Nemine indicante,</hi> saith <hi>Maldonate;</hi> he knew the matter without any Intimations given him by any other hand. And from this Knowledge of his may we justly infer our Lord's Divinity; and to assure us of it did he at this time take occasion to manifest his own Omniscience; so saith <hi>Theophylact,</hi> who tells us, that our Lord spake some words there mention'd in the Context;
<note place="margin">Theophyl. in Joan. 6.61.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, being willing to shew that there is nothing in the hearts of Men concealed from him, as being <hi>God.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis certain that our blessed Saviour foresaw the future <hi>Actions</hi> of Men, and infallibly foreknew
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:205033:85"/>the future <hi>Events</hi> and Issues of things; even such Events, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon Causes, that were not <hi>necessary</hi> but <hi>contingent</hi> only.</p>
            <p>Indeed, where Causes are <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>Necessary,</hi> fixed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, <hi>ad unum.</hi> What their <hi>Effects</hi> yet <hi>to come,</hi> will certainly be, judicious and learned Men can easily foresee. The Change, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, full, and wane of the Moon, the Eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, the rising and setting of both at such or such an hour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon such Causes, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be interrupted by any Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, are certainly foreknown by our skilfull Mathematicians. But where Causes are <hi>Contingent,</hi> such as may be suspended or crossed in their Operations; where <hi>Agents</hi> are <hi>free, ad utramlibet partem,</hi> it being at their own <hi>choice</hi> to act or not to act thus or thus; what will be, or not be, is to the wisest of Men altogether uncertain.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:205033:85"/>
            <p> Such a <hi>Prescience</hi> as <hi>this of future Events</hi> is the peculiar Prerogative of God, and thereby, as by an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Character, doth the Prophet distinguish the true God from false ones:
<note place="margin">Esa. 41.22.</note>
               <hi>Let them shew us what shall happen, and declare us things to come; shew the things that are to come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that we may know that ye are Gods.</hi> This Text imports the truth of that, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> long since asserted;
<note place="margin">Tert. in Apolog. cap. 20. p. 18.</note>
               <hi>Testimonium Divinitatis veritas divinationis;</hi> The true <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> of things to come, is a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of <hi>Divinity.</hi> By this very Argument was God Almighty pleased to evidence the truth of his own Deity; <hi>Behold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 42.9.</note>
               <hi>the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare; before they spring forth, I tell you of them.</hi> 'Tis an Argument of his <hi>Omniscience,</hi> and that is no where to be found, but in a God.</p>
            <p>And the ground thereof is thus given us by <hi>Aquinas;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aqu. 1. Par. qu. 14. Art. 12.</note>
               <hi>Contingentia infallibilitèr a Deo cognoscuntur, in

<note place="margin">Ejusdem qu.

               <note place="margin">Bellarm. de grat. &amp; lib. Arb. l. 4 cap. 13.</note>
               <hi>Deus intelligit res omnes, quae quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo modo esse possunt:</hi> All things, whether in <hi>present Existence,</hi> or but in a <hi>Possibility</hi> of future Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are certainly known to God.</p>
            <p>And such a Knowledge was there found in our blessed Saviour, who well knew, not only the <hi>present Thoughts</hi> of Men, but their <hi>future
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:205033:86"/>Actions</hi> too; the Treason of <hi>Judas,</hi> the time when, the place where, the Persons by whom, and the manner how he should suffer, and when he should rise again; all this he knew beforehand, and foretold his Apostles. That all his Disciples should forsake him, that <hi>Peter</hi> should three times deny him; he was aware, and gave them war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</p>
            <p>These and many other Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of our Saviour's foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things to come, have our Evangelists left us upon Record; so that we may confidently make the same Address, and say toour Redeemer, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Lord, thou knowest All things;</hi> and if so, he that is Omniscient, is and must be God. It's true, the <hi>Sun</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Oculus Mundi,</hi> the <hi>Eye</hi> of the World; and it is said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, To see and hear all things: And for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as well as some other, it was thought and adored as if it had
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:205033:87"/>been a God that knew, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Things past, present, and to come. They who had entertained such thoughts of the <hi>Sun,</hi> may be justly blamed for their gross <hi>Ignorance;</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Supposition, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable for their <hi>Adoration.</hi> For that Being which hath <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an All-seeing Eye, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and omniscient Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is God; and as such must be worshipped.</p>
            <p>And the truth is, the grand Reason, why our Lord thought fit to foretell so many <hi>future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,</hi> which depended upon <hi>free Agents,</hi> and meerly <hi>contingent Causes,</hi> was to declare his own Omniscience, and thereby to prove himself to be, what indeed he was. To this end he told his Disciples thus,
<note place="margin">Joh. 13.19.</note>
               <hi>Now I tell you before it come, that when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he:</hi> What <hi>He</hi> doth he mean? What <hi>He</hi> could certainly foretell so many things
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:205033:87"/>to come? not a mere Man sure;
<note place="margin">Jam. 4.14.</note> for, as St. <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>We know not what shall be on the morrow:</hi> But then what means our Lord, when he saith, <hi>That ye may believe that I am he? Maldonate</hi> well answers thus, <hi>Ʋt credatis me verum esse Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum, non simulatum; verum Deum, qui res omnes, antequam eveniunt, perspectas habeo, quod proprium est Divinitatis;</hi> That ye may believe that I am not a <hi>Counterfeit</hi> Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, but the <hi>True</hi> One; yea, and the <hi>True</hi> God too, who clearly do foresee all things to come; and that's a Perfection <hi>proper</hi> and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to a Deity.</p>
            <p>But if after all this our <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> shall plead again, that our Lord foresaw <hi>future Events,</hi> as <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> did, by <hi>Revelation</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: I answer this is <hi>Gratis dictum,</hi> said indeed, but can never be proyed. But since it is proved by many other Arguments, which cannot be fairly answered, that our Lord is truly God, as well as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:205033:88"/>truly Man; we must conclude, That as he knew things to come by <hi>Revelation,</hi> considered as <hi>Man;</hi> even so, considered as <hi>God,</hi> he knew all things, <hi>Intuitivè,</hi> by his own immediate Inspection, and Intuition. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. My Third and last Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove our Lord's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity shall be this; That blessed Person, who is <hi>Omnipresent,</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense, and Infinite, is truly God. But our Lord is such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>There is no Creature capable of being so; for all created <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> are in some one certain place, <hi>definitivè,</hi> they are determined and limited; and all Corporeal Beings are in one certain place, <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptivè,</hi> they are bounded and circumscribed; 'tis the Prerogative of God alone to be <hi>every where at once.</hi> For, as his <hi>Eternity</hi> is <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent</hi> with all Successions of <hi>Time,</hi> so is his <hi>Immensity commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surate</hi> with all distances of places,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:205033:88"/>wherein he is <hi>Repletivè, per Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, Potentiam, &amp; Praesentiam,</hi> by his Essence, Power, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> speak.</p>
            <p>And the certainty of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Ʋbiquity</hi> we may learn from that demand of God mentioned by the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Jer. 23.24</note>
               <hi>Can any hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in secret places, that I shall not see him, saith the Lord? Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, saith the Lord?</hi> This Question the <hi>Psalmist</hi> thus resolves,
<note place="margin">Ps. 139.8.</note>
               <hi>If I ascend up into Heaven, thou art there; if I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there,</hi> &amp;c. by these and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expressions doth the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> assert God's Omnipresence; and that's a thing,

            <p>And thus it was with our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, even whilst he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed here below; for though his <hi>Humane Nature</hi> then was, and still is, contrary to the Opinion

            </p>
            <p>And this Truth receives a farther and undeniable Confirmation by that Speech of Christ to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3.13.</note>
               <hi>No Man hath ascended up to Heaven, but he that came down
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:205033:89"/>from Heaven, even the Son of Man, which is in Heaven.</hi> 'Tis a strange thing that any Man who believes these Words of Christ, which do so clearly import his <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> should deny, or doubt of his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;</hi> for he was now discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> here on <hi>Earth;</hi> and yet he calls himself the Son of Man, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> which <hi>is,</hi> now <hi>is,</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But how so? not as <hi>Man:</hi> for 'tis impossible for any Man, as such, to be at the same time on <hi>Earth,</hi> and in <hi>Heaven</hi> too. No, we must grant that he was, as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophylact</hi> words it, on <hi>Earth,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in regard of his <hi>Corporeal</hi> Presence; but in <hi>Heaven,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in respect of his <hi>Divinity;</hi> on Earth as <hi>Man;</hi> in Heaven as <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is yet one Text more, which I shall use to prove the same Truth; I mean that Promise which our Lord gave his Apostles imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before his Ascension up to Heaven; <hi>Loe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28.20</note>
               <hi>I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:205033:90"/>even to the end of the World:</hi> But how could that be? He was now removing his <hi>Humane</hi> Nature up to <hi>Heaven;</hi> his Apostles by his Command were to go into <hi>all</hi> the World, and to preach the Gospel, one in this Kingdom, and another in that: And since our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was to be in Heaven, and his Apostles were to be separated, dispersed, and scattered abroad throughout the whole Earth, how could this Promise be made good, <hi>I am with you,</hi> with <hi>every</hi> one of you, and that <hi>alway,</hi> at <hi>all Times,</hi> and in <hi>all Places?</hi> Certainly this Promise could not have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, were not our Lord <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,</hi> and he that is so, is and must be truly God.</p>
            <p>And thus by these Three Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, <hi>Omnipotence, Omniscience,</hi> and <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do ascribe to our blessed Saviour, and which are <hi>peculiar</hi> to <hi>God</hi> alone, I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confirm the certainty of his

               <hi>Divinity;</hi> which I might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by some other Arguments, had I not thought it needless; for he that will not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by these, will be convinced by none.</p>

            <p>What various Opinions have been entertained about this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit, we learn from several Authors:

            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us again, That the <hi>Arians, Eunomians,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi> allow the <hi>Spirit</hi> to be a <hi>Person;</hi>

               </gap>, as an <hi>Instrument,</hi> a <hi>Subject,</hi> of the same rank with other Creatures, and our <hi>Fellow-servant.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many other Errors with which <hi>Origen</hi> stands charged, this is one; namely, that he styled the

            <p>But besides these bolder Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, there were some others, who did not think the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to be a mere <hi>Creature,</hi> but,

               </gap>, the <hi>Vertue</hi> and Efficacy and operative Power of God. But some there were yet more kind, who allowed to the Spirit some <hi>Share</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and thought him a <hi>God;</hi> but, as <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> saith,

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:205033:92"/>as being uncertain, whether he be a Creature or a God.</p>
            <p>These ill Opinions being once raised, were much advanced by the Writings of <hi>Origen,</hi> being a Person of great Learning and Reputation; of whom 'tis said, <hi>Ʋbi bene, nemo melius; ubi male, nemo pejus;</hi> When he wrote <hi>well,</hi> no Man wrote <hi>better;</hi> but when <hi>ill,</hi> no Man <hi>worse.</hi> Nay, these ill Opinions do still receive some Countenance from the Writings of such Men as were <hi>Orthodox</hi> in their Judgments, but too <hi>unwary</hi> in some Expressions. 'Tis well known that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was the prime Defender of the Truth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Arians;</hi> and yet even he hath left some Lines behind him, which are interpreted and do seem to favour that Opinion, which he himself condemned; for, speaking of our Lord and his Holy Spirit,

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The Spirit is of the self-same Substance, and of <hi>equal</hi> Honour with the Father

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; The Scripture doth ascribe to the Divine <hi>Spirit</hi> whatever essential Perfections do belong either to the <hi>Father</hi> or to the <hi>Son,</hi> their natural Excellencies being equal. And that the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit is truly God, equal with the Father and the Son, I shall now endeavour to prove by these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the blessed Spirit is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, hath been in all Ages the general Belief and common Profession of the most Pious, Learned, and Judicious Persons, who were as conversant in, and as well acquainted with the Holy Scriptures, which are the only Rules and Grounds of Divine Faith, as any mortal Man can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope to be.</p>
            <p>To prove the Being of a God against our Modern Atheists, one
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:205033:93"/>Argument commonly used, is drawn from the general consent of Nations; and to prove that this blessed Spirit is that God, we may raise an Argument from the general consent of the Catholick Church. Our common Belief, that there is a God, ariseth from the Discourses and Inferences of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reason, concluding the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of such a Divine Being from the visible Works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Providence; and our common belief, That the blessed Spirit is God, doth arise from the Testimony of those Sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which being well understood, and rightly apprehended by the Reason of Man, are infallible, and cannot fail us. And as we do not doubt the <hi>Being</hi> of a God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some <hi>Atheists,</hi> contrary to the united Sentiments of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind besides, have denied it; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should we doubt the <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the blessed Spirit, because some <hi>Hereticks,</hi> contrary to the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:205033:94"/>joynt Suffrages of the Universal Church, have made bold to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it.</p>
            <p>What hath been, and still is, the belief of the Catholick Church concerning the blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> we learn from those several <hi>Creeds</hi> and Publick Confessions of Faith, which have been, and still are, generally received and owned, as short A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgments of all those Doctrines of Faith, which are delivered more largely in the Holy Scriptures, and are necessary to Man's Salvation. The first of these <hi>Creeds</hi> is that, which bears the Name of our Lord's <hi>Apostles,</hi> as being compiled either by <hi>themselves</hi> before their disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or else collected out of their <hi>Writings,</hi> to be a standing Rule of Faith, by other Apostolical Men, who were their Immediate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</p>
            <p>This most Ancient <hi>Creed,</hi> as to the blessed Spirit, saith no more than this; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghost:</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:205033:94"/>and with this Article some Creeds ended, but none did omit it; no not that,
<note place="margin">Socrat. Hist. Eccl. l. 1. c. 26.</note> which <hi>Arius</hi> himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to that famous Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, and that with this solemn Protestation; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. We have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Faith from the Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels, our Lord saying to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, <hi>Go, teach all Nations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note>
               <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> If we do not thus believe, if we do not truly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> as the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:205033:95"/>Church, and the Scriptures, to which we assent in all things, do teach us, God is our Judge at present, and will be so, when the great Day comes.

<note place="margin">Sozom. Hist. Eccl. l. 2. c. 27.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; he sware an Oath, That without any <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> he did heartily believe all the Articles contained in that <hi>Creed,</hi> whereof that, which relates to the blessed <hi>Spirit</hi> was one.</p>
            <p>And certainly this general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith in the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> contained in the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> is an undeniable Evidence, that the whole <hi>Catholick Church</hi> did suppose and verily believe him to be <hi>truly God,</hi> Equal to the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> True it is, were not the blessed <hi>Spirit</hi> truly God, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of all Mankind could not make him so; but such a Faith is a strong Argument, that all they, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, do judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he certainly is a <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:205033:95"/>indeed. So argued that great Divine <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nazianz. Orat. 37. pag. 596.</note> who menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning this blessed Spirit, writes thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; If the <hi>Spirit</hi> be a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> how come we to <hi>believe</hi> in him? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, To be thus believed on, is a thing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unto God.

            <p>Now then, if the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were Men of great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, signal Industry, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Piety; who searched the Scriptures to the utmost of their power, and in so doing earnestly begged and doubtless found the assistances of Heaven; if such Men as these, after their devout Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and strictest scrutiny into such
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:205033:103"/>and such Texts, found cause to believe the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and did accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>Religious Services</hi> to him, methinks their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> should be a very great Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us to believe his <hi>Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, 'tis not reasonable to think, that the Divine Providence should permit such great numbers of the most learned and pious Men, who were the Pillars of the Catholick Church, to lie under such a gross Mistake in a matter of such great Importance, as must needs lead themselves into an Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and by their Example and Writings transmit the same to all succeeding Ages. 'Tis a Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I think, not reconcilable to several Promises; our Lord told his Apostles,
<note place="margin">Joh. 16.13.</note>
               <hi>The Spirit of truth will guide you into all truth.</hi> And if it be supposed that this Promise was <hi>Personal,</hi> and concern'd none but the <hi>Apostles</hi> only; yet there is another, which relates to the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:205033:103"/>Church in general; for, saith our Lord,
<note place="margin">Mat. 16.18.</note>
               <hi>The Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it:</hi> nay, there is a Promise, which reacheth <hi>every</hi> good Man in particular;
<note place="margin">Joh. 7.17.</note>
               <hi>If any Man will do his Will, he shall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God:</hi> These and the like Promises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considered as to their <hi>Matter,</hi> and acknowledged as to their <hi>Truth,</hi> 'tis not imaginable, that the Divine Providence and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should permit the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and the choicest Members of it, and that from Age to Age, to lie under so great a Mistake, as to believe the blessed <hi>Spirit</hi> to be truly God, and to <hi>worship</hi> him as such, if he were not so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>I conclude this Argument with the Testimony of <hi>Hildebert,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Tours,</hi> and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Poet, who, in a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant <hi>Hymn</hi> touching the glorious Trinity, writes thus concerning the blessed <hi>Spirit.</hi>

               <hi>Of his own Will he begat us.</hi> And for this Reason, the regenerate Person is said to be <hi>born of God,</hi> a Child, a Son, an Heir of God.</p>
            <p>And as every good Man's new Birth or Regeneration is ascribed to <hi>God,</hi> so more particularly is it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:205033:105"/>ascribed to the <hi>Spirit;</hi> he that is said to be <hi>born of God</hi> in one place, is said to be born of the Spirit in another; so speaks our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,

               </gap>. It doth in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Words testifie, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of the Children of God is the proper Work of the Holy <hi>Spirit;</hi>

            <p>Now from this Supernatural Work of Man's Regeneration we may justly inferr the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and conclude, as <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> doth,

They who have received the Privilege of being made the Children of God, do, by their very being so, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the <hi>Divinity</hi> of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> For since Man's Regeneration is the undoubted Work of <hi>God,</hi> and yet the proper Work of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> it must follow by an undeniable Consequence, that the Spirit is God indeed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My third Argument to prove the Divinity of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit shall be this: If the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be the Word of God, then is the Holy Spirit God. But the Scriptures certainly are the Word of God.</p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:205033:106"/>
            <p> The Divinity of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, did our <hi>Socinians</hi> deny the Authority of the <hi>whole</hi> Bible, as they do that of some <hi>particular</hi> Texts, might be proved from a great variety of proper <hi>Topicks.</hi> The punctual <hi>accomplishment</hi> of its <hi>Prophecies,</hi> such as foretold <hi>future Contingencies</hi> at the greatest distances of time; even such E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents as were exceedingly <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;</hi> nay some Events as were, according to the common course of Nature, utterly <hi>impossible:</hi> Such were our Lord's Birth from a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and his Resurrection from the dead. Besides, the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Excellence of Scripture <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> far transcending the choicest Rules of the best ancient Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists; the stupendious <hi>Miracles,</hi> which were often wrought by our Lord himself, by his Prophets and Apostles, purposely to confirm their Doctrine; the undaunted <hi>Courage</hi> and matchless <hi>Patience</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who suffered the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:205033:106"/>greatest Tortures which Men or Devils could invent, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and in the defence of Scripture-Truths; it's wonderful <hi>Preservation</hi> from Age to Age a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Swords</hi> of powerful <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi> and the <hi>Pens</hi> of subtle <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;</hi> its mighty <hi>Effects</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the most obstinate Hearts of Men; each of these, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the constant <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and the frequent <hi>Testimonies</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, might be managed as an Argument to confirm its Divine Authority.</p>
            <p>But there is one Argument more, which alone would be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; and this it is: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot proceed from <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> whether good or bad; for as to <hi>religious</hi> Men, and <hi>Holy</hi> Angels, it were utterly inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with their Goodness to forge and counterfeit such and such Records, and then to father them upon God, and impose them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:205033:107"/>the World, as the Oracles of Heaven: And as for <hi>wicked</hi> Men and wicked Angels, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot with any shew of Reason be imputed unto them, because they cross their designs, contradict their Inclinations, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid what they love, command what they hate, condemn their Practices, and sentence their Persons to everlasting Flames. Now, if the Scriptures came not from <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> they must come from <hi>God;</hi> for no other Author of them can possibly be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Now, if the Scriptures be, as most certainly they are, the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> then may we thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly conclude, that the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> because to him, as their immediate and undoubted <hi>Author,</hi> the Scriptures are once and again entituled. St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>God spake by the Mouth of his holy Prophets:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1.70.</note> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>All Scripture is given by Inspiration of</hi>

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:205033:108"/> 4. My fourth Argument, and the last which I shall or need use, to prove the Godhead of the Holy Spirit, shall be this: If our blessed Saviour, in respect of his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> be indeed the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> then is the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> God. But most certain it is, that our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in respect of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, is indeed the Son of God.</p>
            <p>I do not read of any one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son throughout the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, that ever called our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour <hi>Son of Man,</hi> but he was pleased frequently so to style himself; nay he styles himself <hi>the Son,</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but in the <hi>Masculine</hi> Gender, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Title, from which some <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> took occasion to say, That <hi>Joseph</hi> was, not his <hi>supposed,</hi> but his <hi>real</hi> Father. But, the truth is, that as our Lord, in respect of his Divinity, was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Mother;</hi> so in respect of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:205033:108"/>his <hi>Humanity,</hi> he was, as to Men, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without a Father. And yet notwithstanding this, he might well be called <hi>The Son of Man,</hi> as he was the Son, <hi>i.</hi> one of the <hi>Posterity</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> who were <hi>Men,</hi> and from whom his Virgin <hi>Mother</hi> was lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended.</p>
            <p>But as our Lord did frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call himself, <hi>The Son of Man,</hi> so did he many times style him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>The Son of God</hi> too. And the Son of God he was and is, in respect of his <hi>Deity,</hi> by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and necessary <hi>Generation;</hi> and, in respect of his <hi>Humanity,</hi> by a voluntary and miraculous <hi>Conception</hi> and <hi>Birth,</hi> in the fulness of time. His Sonship to God by an eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our <hi>Socinians</hi> will not grant; but his Sonship to God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his wonderful <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I think, they do not deny.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:205033:109"/>
            <p> Now, if it be granted, as indeed it ought to be, that our Lord is indeed the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in respect of his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> it must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be granted, that the Holy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is <hi>God;</hi> for to him, as its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Author,</hi> is the Humane Nature of Christ ascribed. When <hi>Joseph</hi> was minded to put away his Wife, as being then with Child,
<note place="margin">Mat. 1.20.</note> but not by him, an <hi>Angel</hi> was sent to tell him thus, <hi>That which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost:</hi> And that it should be so, the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> styled <hi>Angelus Misericordiae,</hi> The Angel of <hi>Mercy,</hi> had foretold his Mother before her Conception; <hi>The Holy Ghost shall come upon Thee, and the Power of the Highest shall overshadow Thee:</hi> And what then?
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.35.</note>
               <hi>Therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.</hi> From hence it is evident, that our Lord, as <hi>Man,</hi> is the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:205033:109"/>his whole Humane Nature was framed by the Invisible Power and operation of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> who, for that very reason, if the Angel's Inference have any thing of Truth and Pertinence in it, is and must be acknowledged God.</p>
            <p>And thus have I endeavoured to prove the <hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> by four Arguments; First, by the general belief of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, consisting of such great numbers of pious and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, so well acquainted with the word of God, and so well qualified for the assistances of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that we cannot piously or charitably imagine, that after all their indefatigable industry in searching the Scriptures, and their dayly Petitions to God for the Illuminations of his Holy Spirit, they should still be mistaken from Age to Age in such an Important Article of our Creed. Secondly, By the work of Grace or Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:205033:110"/>by vertue whereof eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sanctified Soul is said to be born of God, because born of the Spirit. Thirdly, By the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is therefore the word of God, because it was dictated to the Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles, by the Immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations of the Holy Ghost. Fourthly, By our blessed Saviour's being the Son of God in respect of his Manhood; his Soul being immediately created, and his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy miraculously framed of his Mothers Substance, being first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Sanctified by the powerful Operation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>But to elude all Arguments drawn from those Divine <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which the Scriptures attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we prove his <hi>Deity;</hi> our <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> affirm that he is no <hi>Person:</hi> So thought <hi>Socinus</hi> himself, who made bold to say, <hi>Credo me satis
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:205033:110"/>ostendisse Spiritum Sanctum non esse Personam,</hi> I believe that I have sufficiently shewed that the Holy Spirit is not a Person; but what is he then? <hi>Virtus Dei vel effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> He is the <hi>Vertue,</hi> Power, or Efficacy of God, and no more: so He.</p>
            <p>To this Heretical Opinion of <hi>Socinus</hi> we might oppose the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judgments and vast numbers of learned Men.

            <p>These and a multitude of other learned Men, found sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe the <hi>Personality</hi> of the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> by the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of several <hi>Actions,</hi> which are clearly ascribed unto him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven such <hi>Actions,</hi> as are <hi>proper</hi> and peculiar to <hi>Persons</hi> only.

            <p> But that such <hi>Personal Actions,</hi> ascribed to the blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> do indeed prove him to be a <hi>Person,</hi> our <hi>Socinians</hi> will not grant; for, say they, and truly too, Personal Actions, in other cases, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Texts, are clearly ascribed to <hi>things,</hi> which are not <hi>Persons.

            <p>That such Actions are clearly ascribed to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to <hi>God</hi> alone, our <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> cannot deny, and from such Actions, being <hi>Personally</hi> his, the Fathers do justly conclude his <hi>God head.</hi>

               </gap>, The <hi>Identity</hi> of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration</hi> betwixt the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> doth manifestly shew the <hi>Identity</hi> of their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, because the force of this Argument cannot be escaped by
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:205033:116"/>a downright <hi>denial,</hi> our <hi>Socinians</hi> found themselves concerned to think of some <hi>Evasion,</hi> and fixed upon this; they tell us, that those Divine Actions, which are <hi>fign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively</hi> ascribed to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> were <hi>really</hi> done by <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> for, say they, the <hi>Spirit</hi> is nothing else, but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the working and effectual <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and to this <hi>Spirit</hi> such and such works are ascribed.

            <p>But this slender pretence of our <hi>Socinians</hi> is clearly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and utterly baffled by the Pen of a late and very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Bishop</hi> of our own Church,
<note place="margin">Pearsonus in Exposit. Symboli Apostol.</note> who, to the satisfaction of all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Men, and to the shame of these <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hath unanswerably demonstrated, that there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:205033:117"/>Actions ascribed to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Spirit,</hi> which can never be ascribed to God the <hi>Father.</hi> The Spirit is said <hi>to make Intercession for us,</hi> but that the <hi>Father</hi> cannot be said to do; for, with whom can he be thought to Intercede? Again, the Spirit is said to be <hi>sent</hi> by the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> but the <hi>Father</hi> himself cannot be said to be <hi>sent,</hi> and to come as being sent, as the Spirit doth; for, who should <hi>send</hi> him? Yet once more, our Lord saith of the Spirit, <hi>He shall not speak of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak.</hi> This cannot be said of God the <hi>Father;</hi> for, whatever he <hi>speaks,</hi> whatever he <hi>doth,</hi> he <hi>speaks</hi> and <hi>doth</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Since therefore such and such Actions are ascribed to the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which cannot be attributed to God the <hi>Father;</hi> this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a <hi>Prosopopoeia</hi> is altogether
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:205033:117"/>insufficient; because the <hi>Spirit,</hi> considered, as our <hi>Socinians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him, namely and only as a <hi>powerful quality</hi> or Energy, by which God the <hi>Father</hi> Acts, cannot be thought to do such Actions, as are by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to God the <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as those Operations, which cannot be imputed to God the <hi>Father,</hi> do prove the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which doth them, to be a <hi>Person</hi> distinct from the Father; so his Glorious <hi>Attributes</hi> and many Divine <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> do prove him to be a <hi>Person Equal</hi> to the <hi>Father.</hi> For, that he is <hi>Coeternal</hi> with him, is a truth warranted by several Texts, and accordingly testified by <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen,</hi>

For our worshipping the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> we have <hi>Commands;</hi> for besides our Lord's Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requiring us to be <hi>Baptized</hi> into the <hi>Name,</hi> the <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> every Text which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to worship <hi>God,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to worship the <hi>Spirit</hi> too. For, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> well determines this matter, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Adoration of <hi>One God</hi> is the Adoration of the <hi>Three Persons,</hi> because they are of the <hi>same Honour,</hi> Dignity, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. And whenever we pray to God without a particular Application to this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Person, we pray to them <hi>all,</hi> as being <hi>one</hi> and the same God undivided.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:205033:119"/> 2. For our worshipping the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit we have Examples; and such Examples as deserve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our Imitation.</p>
            <p>That of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is one, who thus concludes one of his Epistles, <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.14.</note>
               <hi>and the Love of God, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.</hi> That these Words are a <hi>Prayer,</hi> I think no Man will deny: As such doth <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> own it; and St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> expresly saith of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He doth here end his Discourse with a <hi>Prayer.</hi> And if it be a <hi>Prayer,</hi> to <hi>whom</hi> doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it? either to no body, or else to the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. For, as <hi>Grotius</hi> observes, <hi>Sunt hic, ut &amp; in Baptismo, apertè nomina,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The whole <hi>Trinity</hi> is here expresly named, as it also is in the Form of Baptism;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:205033:120"/>so that if St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth here pray at all, he prayeth to the <hi>Father,</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> and to the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And since St. <hi>Paul</hi> did direct his humble Petitions for Spiritual Blessings to none but God; we may from this Request of his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry justly infer the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> So thought several Interpreters of this Text:
<note place="margin">Estius in locum.</note>
               <hi>Hoc lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co distincte nobis insinuantur tres in Divinis Personae:</hi> So one: And thus another;

               </gap>, <hi>consubstantialem, eam scilicet ejusdem esse naturae, potentiae, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi>

And from this place doth <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> draw an Argument, <hi>Quòd venerabilis est Sancta Trinitas non separata, nec a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienata.</hi> Hence also doth St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi> and after him <hi>Theophylact,</hi> break out into this Expression, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Where now are they who slight
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:205033:120"/>the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as if he were not <hi>God,</hi> since St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself doth here address his solemn Petition as well to the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> as to the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after the Example of this great Apostle, and in a firm Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, That the blessed <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> have many pious and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Men made their Religious Addresses to him; particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances I have already named; as that of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And that of St. <hi>Cyprian, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esto, Sancte Spiritus,</hi> &amp;c. Nor did <hi>particular</hi> Persons only thus invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in their <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions;</hi> but <hi>whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi> did so in their <hi>publick Supplications</hi> too; such a Prayer I find in that <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chrysost. Liturg. tom. 6. p. 986</note> and is extant amongst his Works, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God Almighty is petitioned
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:205033:121"/>thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Grant thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to thy Servants, who call on thy Name, even the Name of the <hi>Father,</hi> and of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> And as the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> was thus particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly mentioned in their Publick <hi>Supplications;</hi> so was he as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly named in their Publick <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> too: So I find it in that <hi>Doxology,</hi> which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated over and over: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is meet and just to adore the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that Trinity of Persons, which is <hi>Consubstantial</hi> and Indivisible. To this I may add that <hi>Eucharistical</hi> Appendix to the <hi>Te Deum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Usserius de Symbolis, p. 2.</note> cited by our late very learned <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Armagh, Te Patrem adoramus aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,

            <p>And now I could heartily wish that all our <hi>Socinians</hi> would se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously consider, but not corrupt those Texts which do clearly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our blessed Saviour and his <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> such Texts as do most expresly give the <hi>Title</hi> of God to them <hi>both;</hi> such Texts as do plainly ascribe to them both such <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Operations,</hi> as no <hi>Creature</hi> can be capable of; I wish they would consider the Example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the constant Practice of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in making their
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:205033:122"/>
               <hi>Religious</hi> Addresses to them both in their Publick <hi>Supplications</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings;</hi> That they would no longer reject the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which is so clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, barely because their own narrow Understandings are no more able to comprehend it, than a little Spoon is to contain the Water of the whole Ocean. That they may quit and repent of their Heretical Opinion, lest they run themselves into that <hi>Blasphemy</hi> which, through final Impenitence, will certainly prove irremissible. I shall conclude this Discourse with that Prayer which I find in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> ascribed to St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi>
